<HEADLINE> Brazil, Malaysia to Launch Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and
Malaysia are to jointly launch a series of remote sensing
satellites (RSS) from 1998 to monitor tropical forests.
</P>
<P>
The launching of the RSSs, the first of this kind of satellite
on a permanent orbit 900 kilometers above the equator, is
estimated to cost 37 millon U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The RSSs will monitor 2,200 square kilometers of the Amazon
rain forest, which it will pass over every 105 minutes, said
Brazil's National Institute of Space Research.
</P>
<P>
Satellites currently monitoring the region cannot see clearly
through the thick clouds which cover the region for several months
annually, but the RSSs can do that.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, which is in charge of the design of the RSS, plans to
build a land-monitoring base in the Cuiaba city, located in
Amazon's Pantanal wetlands.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, also endowed with rich tropical rain forest, will
build bases on its territory to pick up and analyse data from the
satellites.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Brazilian institute, Marcio Nogueira Barbosa,
recently visited Malaysia to negotiate the joint launching of the
RSSs, a project which is estimated to last eight years.
