<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A tropical rain forest project is
to start soon in south China's Hainan province.
</P>
<P>
Under the program tropical rain-forest trees will be planted,
along with tropical fruit trees and economic trees. Related
agricultural and sideline product processing zones will also be
established in the area of 5,400 hectares in Jianfeng Mountain
area, Ledong county in southern parts of Hainan province.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost 35 million US dollars, with 18 million
coming from Asian Development Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Cui Xiaosu, an official in charge of the implementation of the
project, said that the theme of the project will focus on
environmental protection and help the poor in the project area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Cui is also confident about the economic returns of
the project, since the area boasts rich land resources and
favorable soil and climate conditions for the growing of tropical
rain trees.
</P>
<P>
The project area now has 12,000 people, mainly of the Li
nationality.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the project will stimulate local economic
development, expand employment and improve farming skills of local
people. More than 30,000 people are expected to benefit from the
project.
</P>
<P>
Jianfeng Mountain tropical rain forest, covering more than
44,600 hectares, is now the largest in China. The forest is of
great importance to the environmental and ecological protection in
Hainan province and even Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
There are also many endangered and unique plants in the area.
</P>
<P>
Chinese government has always attached great importance to the
protection of this area. It first set up a tropical primary forest
protection zone in the area in 1951. A national forest garden was
established there in 1992, and in 1993, Hainan provincial
government decided to stop commercial tree felling in the area.
