<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Informs Tourists of Bird Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is trying to
persuade tourists that it is safe to come to the city because the
bird flu is not so serious as to trigger an outbreak.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health prepared a fact sheet to explain to
tourists the avian flu, which is caused by a virus H5N1 that is
only found in poultry. Seven people have been infected so far,
with two dead and two in critical conditions.
</P>
<P>
The present cluster of cases in Hong Kong has not reached the
scale of an outbreak, the fact sheet quoted the World Health
Organization's statement as saying. There is no need for travel
restriction or quarantine.
</P>
<P>
The sheet of paper provided information of Influenza A H5N1,
cautioning tourists to keep up a good body immunity. But it said
that eating chicken and other poultry would not pose a risk of
H5N1 infection.
