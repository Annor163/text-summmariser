<HEADLINE> Macao Citizens Asked to Stay Calm About Bird Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Macao experts today warned
residents to be careful but not panic over the bird flu that has
killed children in neighboring Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
No bird flu case has been found in Macao and people should stay
calm, experts from the Macao Nurses' Association and the Public
Health Department said.
</P>
<P>
But they did urge people to be careful in contacting birds,
take care of proper personal and environmental hygiene and cook
their food thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
Leung Iok Va, deputy-secretary-general of the Macao Nurses'
Association, told the Macao Daily News today that there is no
effective way of prevention as the cause and way of transmission
of the bird flu on human beings have not been found.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local dealers of imported fowls said imported
chickens, ducks and geese are safe to eat because they have passed
strict examinations before they are put on the local market.
</P>
<P>
The poultry imported from China's inland areas are from a
different source from those imported by Hong Kong, they said.
While Hong Kong's imports mostly come from Shenzhen, Macao's are
mainly from Zhuhai, Zhongshan and Jiangmen cities.
</P>
<P>
The experts want local residents to buy poultry only at
licensed food stalls, saying those sold by illegal mobile vendors
might be unsafe.
