<HEADLINE> Macao Residents Urged to Keep Away from Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Public Health Department of
Macao has called on residents to avoid contacting birds, and take
proper protective measures if they have to.
</P>
<P>
In a notice issued through the Macao Daily News Thursday, the
health department said that residents should avoid contacting
birds in case they might be infected with the deadly virus of bird
flu known as H5N1.
</P>
<P>
Although several cases were reported in Hong Kong, none was
found in Macao so far. It is still unclear in which way human
being catches the virus.
</P>
<P>
The department said that people who have to contact birds
should wear disposable gloves and protective suits, and wash their
hands thoroughly after finishing their work.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it reminded people to avoid staying with birds for
a long time in a closed space where ventilation is poor.
</P>
<P>
People should also see doctors immediately for proper treatment
if they have fever or respiratory diseases. They should tell
doctors of their contacts with birds.
</P>
<P>
But it said the risk of infection is low because the H5N1 virus
was only found in imported chicken so far.
