<HEADLINE> HK Sets Up Working Group to Deal with Bird Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) set up an
inter-department working group today to coordinate efforts towards
the prevention and control of the spread of a mysterious "bird
flu" that has killed two people.
</P>
<P>
A SAR government spokesman said the group, which comprises
representatives from various government departments, will hold its
first meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The group will coordinate measures necessary for the prevention
and control of the "bird flu," or H5N1 virus, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Chickens have been identified as the most likely source of a
new strain of the flu.
</P>
<P>
The move came after three more people were suspected last week
to have been stricken with the H5NI virus, bringing the number of
confirmed or suspected cases to seven.
</P>
<P>
A 5-year-old child died in May in the first known case of a
human contracting the virus. A 54-year-old man died early this
month, and a 2-year-old boy recovered after hospitalization in
November.
</P>
<P>
Three more people remained hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The government also announced today that authorities in the
neighboring Guangdong Province have agreed to step up the
monitoring of chicken diseases at farms there.
</P>
<P>
A statement said Guangdong also plans to restrict chicken
exports to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Experts say they are baffled by the virus, and the hospital
authority has issued guidelines to the public and hospitals to
treat the potentially deadly flu.
</P>
<P>
There has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission of
the virus, and no infected chickens have been found at the market,
according to a source from the local health department.
</P>
<P>
Three more experts from the Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta in the United States arrived in Hong Kong Thursday to help
in the investigation, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization has reportedly been asked to
alert vaccine production centers worldwide to follow developments
with a view to preparing the necessary vaccine.
