Influenza Center confirmed that no cases of H5N1 virus infection
have been discovered in the inland areas, even though the strain
has been detected a small group of Hong Kong residents.

Surveillance work targeting the virus will be intensified
across the country. "However, there is no need to panic about the
possibility of an epidemic," according to experts.

The virus, known to cause "bird influenza" in chickens, has
been transferred to human beings in Hong Kong. The virus is
believed to be transmitted through direct contact with poultry or
from contact with bird droppings.

research, experts said.

Surveillance has been strengthened in some south China
provinces since August, especially in the cities of Guangzhou and
Shenzhen which border on the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR). Experts noted that "human blood samples have have
not as yet been tested for the virus."
