<HEADLINE> No Chance of Bird Flu in Nepal: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 8 (Xinhua) -- There is no chance of an
outbreak in Nepal of the bird flu, which has claimed four lives in
Hong Kong, The Kathmandu Post Thursday quoted experts as saying.

"There is not even remote chance of occurrence of the
particular strain of influenza causing virus H5N1 at present in
Nepal since no poultry products are imported from Hong Kong," D.
D. Joshi, an pathologist from the National Zoonosis and Food
Hygiene Research Center, was quoted as saying.

Dr. B. B. Karki, director of the Epidemiology and Disease
Control Division, agreed. "We have the habit of eating well-cooked
chicken meat, unlike in Hong Kong, where they prefer half-cooked
dishes, so there is no chance of emergence of this disease in
Nepal," he said.

<P>
But he added that no one can be one hundred percent sure that
the particular strain of the virus does not exist in Nepal since
there are no well-developed laboratory facilities and enough
pathologists to trace the virus.

<P>
The bird flu was last seen in Nepal in 1974-75, he said.
