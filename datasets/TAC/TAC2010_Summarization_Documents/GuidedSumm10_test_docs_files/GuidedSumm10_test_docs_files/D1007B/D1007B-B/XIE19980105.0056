<HEADLINE> No "Bird Flu" Case Detected in Macao: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Macao government official
said on Sunday that there had been no "bird flu" case detected in
Macao "up until now."
</P>
<P>
Alarcao Troni, secretary for social affairs and budget, told a
medical seminar here that no human being or animal had been found
to have been infected with the disease.
</P>
<P>
The official said the government was making vigorous efforts to
prevent the disease. A number of "bird flu" cases have been found
in Hong Kong in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Health Department officials said earlier that not even a
suspected case was found in Macao. There was also no case of
chickens being infected with the H5N1 virus.
</P>
<P>
However, officials have stepped up inspection of imported and
locally-raised poultry. Local hospitals have also bought enough
medicine for 200 such patients.
</P>
<P>
Haunted by fears of the deadly virus, many local residents have
turned to pigeons, geese and pork as substitutes for chickens,
prompting a drop in the sales of chickens in Macao.
