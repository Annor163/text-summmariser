A Florida teacher who admitted 
having sex several times with her 14-year-old student was freed 
Tuesday after prosecutors dropped sexual abuse charges to avoid 
calling the boy to the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
In the case that drew national US media attention, Ocala, 
Florida prosecutor Brad King said he decided to withdraw the charges 
because forcing the victim to testify could further traumatize him.
</P>
<P>
The attractive blonde, blue-eyed teacher, Debra LaFave, 25, had 
earlier admitted to having had sex with her student several times in 
2004, including in a mobile classroom where she taught and twice 
inside a car driven by the victim's older brother, who was only 15.
</P>
<P>
After the victim's family voiced concerns that forcing him to 
testify against the teacher amid intense media attention would be 
traumatizing, LaFave's lawyers and prosecutors reached a deal in 
which she would avoid prison while accepting a sentence of three 
years of partial house arrest and seven years of conditional 
release.
</P>
<P>
However, earlier Tuesday Judge Hale Stancil rejected the deal, 
saying it would allow a defendant to beat a conviction for the mere 
reason that the victim wanted to avoid testifying because of 
excessive media attention.
</P>
<P>
"Accepting the proposed plea agreement would undermine the 
credibility of this court, and the criminal justice system as a 
whole, and would erode public confidence in our schools," he wrote 
in his ruling.
</P>
<P>
But afterwards the prosecutor then decided to give up the case 
in order to protect the boy.
</P>
<P>
"The court may be willing to risk the well-being of the victims 
in this case in order to force it to trial. I am not," King said.
</P>
<P>
"Crime victims are not all alike; all have their own unique 
injury and their own unique vulnerabilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
The case became national news and turned LaFave into a 
celebrity, with pictures circulating on the Internet of her in a 
bikini and a sexy dress astride a motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
Early in the trial last November, her lawyer John Fitzgibbons 
attempted to play her beauty as a card in her defense, arguing she 
was too pretty to be imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
"To place an attractive young woman in that kind of hell hole is 
like putting a piece of raw meat in with the lions," he told the 
court.
</P>
<P>
In a televised news conference after the charges were dropped, 
LaFave attributed her behavior to bipolar disorder, and attacked 
journalists for judgmental coverage of her case. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very nervous. I have a lot of things in my part that 
unfortunately became very public," she said about her feelings while 
in the court.
</P>
<P>
LaFave said she was taking medical treatment for bipolarity, and 
meanwhile also planned to study journalism.
