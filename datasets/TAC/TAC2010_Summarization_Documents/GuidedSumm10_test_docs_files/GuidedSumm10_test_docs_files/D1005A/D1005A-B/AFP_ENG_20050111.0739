Family to visit Cuban dissident

<P>
A Cuban dissident will be able to 
visit two grandchildren she has never met, although Cuba continues 
to refuse her an exit visa, her son said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The son of dissident Hilda Molina, Roberto Quinones, said his 
wife and two children would travel from Buenos Aires to Cuba in May 
to celebrate Molina's birthday and that of their youngest child. The 
three have Argentine citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Quinones said he would not accompany them because he had not 
received adequate guarantees from Havana, but would continue to push 
for his mother's right to travel.
</P>
<P>
Molina, 61, a neurosurgeon, has campaigned for 10 years for 
permission to travel to Argentina to see her son, her two 
grandchildren and other members of her family.
</P>
<P>
Molina, who is renowned as a pioneer in the transplant of fetal 
stem cells into the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease, ran 
afoul of President Fidel Castro's Communist regime in 1994 when she 
raised ethical concerns about the process.
</P>
<P>
Facing persecution for her beliefs, she renounced her Communist 
Party membership and joined a dissident doctors' group.
</P>
<P>
Molina's case has provoked a diplomatic crisis between Havana 
and the government in Buenos Aires, which supports her right to 
travel.
