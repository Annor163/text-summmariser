Gene flaw opens way to tests for Parkinson's disease

<P>
Scientists believe they have pinpointed a 
tiny genetic flaw that is to blame for around four percent of all 
cases of Parkinson's, a discovery that could eventually open the 
way, albeit controversially, to genetic testing for the disease.
</P>
<P>
The problem lies with a single mutation in a gene called LRRK2, 
according to three studies published online Tuesday by the British 
medical publication The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
Researchers spotted the flaw by scanning and comparing the DNA 
of individuals with Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
LRRK2 is a recently discovered gene which encodes for a large 
protein called dardarin whose function is unclear.
</P>
<P>
Two of the studies found the mutation among four out of 61 
Italian, Brazilian and Portuguese families with a history of 
Parkinson's and among 35 individuals from 20 North American families 
where the disease had also struck.
</P>
<P>
The LRRK2 flaw causes around five percent of inherited cases of 
Parkinson's, according to an extrapolation of these figures.
</P>
<P>
However, the real proportion "is probably substantially higher," 
said William Nichols, of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical 
Centre, who lead-authored the North American study.
</P>
<P>
"Mutations in this gene could become the most important cause of 
disease susceptibility for Parkinson's disease identified so far."
</P>
<P>
The third study was conducted among British patients with 
Parkinson's who did not have a family history of the disease.
</P>
<P>
In this research, the gene flaw was spotted in eight out of 482 
patients, a rate of 1.6 percent, which suggests that the mutation 
can also occur sporadically.
</P>
<P>
Cases classified as sporadic have no inherited cause. Exposure 
to harmful chemicals, radiation or some other environmental factor 
are the usual chief suspects.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, also published by The Lancet, specialist Alexis 
Brice of France's National Institute for Health and Medical Research 
(INSERM) said the findings were a step towards the eventual 
introduction of genetic tests to predict susceptibility to 
Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, it was vital to gain as complete a picture as 
possible about the genetic causes for the disease -- whether, for 
instance, people with the mutated LRRK2 gene did not develop 
Parkinson's and if other faulty genes might also be implicated with 
the disease.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it was vital to address ethical issues, Brice 
stressed. Parkinson's is degenerative and incurable, although its 
symptoms can be eased with drugs. So testing for the diseases would 
offer no direct medical benefit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's is a degenerative disease of the nervous system, 
affecting more than one percent of people over the age of 65.
</P>
<P>
It occurs when there is a loss of cells in a part of the brain 
that produces dopamine, a neurotransmitter that communicates with 
other brain cells which regulate motor functions. Symptoms range 
from tremors and awkwardness and muscular stiffness to a distinctive 
shuffling gait.
</P>
<P>
Well-known sufferers include Pope John Paul II and the actor 
Michael J. Fox.
