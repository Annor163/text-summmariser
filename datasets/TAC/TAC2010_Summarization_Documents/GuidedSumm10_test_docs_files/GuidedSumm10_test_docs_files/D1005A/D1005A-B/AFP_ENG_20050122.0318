Tobacco may have at least one virtue 
-- that of providing some protection against the onset of 
Parkinson's disease, according to a new Swedish study.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Karolinska Institute, Sweden's leading 
medical research center, looked at the medical and death records of 
sets of Swedish twins, in which one smoked and the other did not.
</P>
<P>
"Many studies have shown a protective effect of cigarette 
smoking on Parkinson's disease," said the study published online 
this month by the Annals of Neurology -- but many have argued that 
this may have been due to genetic factors. 
</P>
<P>
By studying twins with different life styles, the researchers 
said they sought to exclude the genetic factor. 
</P>
<P>
They found no association between Parkinson's disease, a 
degenerative neurological condition, and alcohol, coffee or place of 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
But smokers appeared to be less affected, which the researchers 
said, confirmed "the protective effect of smoking on Parkinson's 
disease" and established that the association "is only partially 
explained by genetic and familial environmental factors."
