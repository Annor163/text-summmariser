<P>
Up to 500 animal rights activists marched 
through England's historic city of Oxford to protest against a 
controversial animal research lab under construction at the famed 
university nearby.
</P>
<P>
Dressed in animal suits, blowing whistles and carrying banners, 
demonstrators called for a halt to plans to start work again next 
month at a site for a future animal lab.
</P>
<P>
Construction at the 18-million-pound (34-million-dollar, 
26-million-euro) facility, billed as a state-of-the-art center 
focusing on finding cures for ills including leukemia and 
Parkinson's disease, was halted in July after the university charged 
activists with harassing contractors.
</P>
<P>
Oxford won a court injunction in November against the rights 
group SPEAK, blocking them from "exclusion zones" set up around the 
new lab and the homes of Oxford administrators. The activists have 
the right to one protest on Thursday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
Robert Cogswell from SPEAK said the turnout sent a "good 
message" to the university about the determination of protestors.
</P>
<P>
"We expect work to start soon and we'll be going on the 
offensive against Oxford University and contractors," he said, 
adding that they would act "within a legal framework".
</P>
<P>
Local police said no arrests had been made during the four-hour 
event.
