Japanese researchers said Tuesday they had 
successfully treated monkeys with Parkinson's disease through a stem 
cell transplant, potentially paving the way for an ideal remedy to 
the intractable disease.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time such transplants have worked on primates 
suffering from the degenerative nerve disorder, said Nobuo 
Hashimoto, a medical doctor at the Department of Neurosurgery at 
Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
"First, we have to confirm the effectiveness will last long," 
said Hashimoto, the chief researcher of the study.
</P>
<P>
"Once we can confirm the safety of the therapy, we want the 
method to be applied to humans," Hashimoto said. "We hope clinical 
applications on humans will be available in about five years."
</P>
<P>
"There are many approaches to curing the disease, such as strong 
drugs or destruction of troubled cells in the brain, but use of 
embryonic stem cells is seen as an ideal and fundamental therapy for 
the disease," he said.
</P>
<P>
The researchers extracted embryonic stem cells capable of 
releasing dopamine, a neurotransmitter, from fertilized eggs of 
cynomolgus monkeys.
</P>
<P>
It is a decline in production of dopamine that is believed to 
trigger Parkinson's disease, in which patients shake 
uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
The embryonic stem cells were then transplanted into six 
cynomolgus monkeys, which had drug-induced symptoms similar to 
Parkinson's disease in humans.
</P>
<P>
Three months later, the monkeys' symptoms such as trembling 
hands had lessened, Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>
Details of the experiment were published on the website of the 
Journal of Clinical Investigation on Tuesday.
