Investigators seeking the cause of a plane crash in which 121 people died are
focusing on possible technical problems suffered by the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
New autopsy results showed passengers were still alive when the plane crashed
into a hillside north of Athens Sunday, but coroners hope further tests will
show whether toxic gases possibly rendered them unconscious.
</P>
<P>
The Helios Airways flight from Larnaca to Athens had been carrying 115
passengers _ including 20 children _ and six crew.
</P>
<P>
Investigators were still searching for the remains of three people, while
relatives had identified only 26 bodies by late Tuesday. The remains of the
plane's German pilot were not among them.
</P>
<P>
Investigators were also looking into claims that the plane had suffered
technical problems in the past.
</P>
<P>
A former chief mechanic for Helios, Kyriakos Pilavakis, said the Boeing 737-300
had lost cabin pressure during a flight last December, after a door was
apparently not sealed properly.
</P>
<P>
"It was a flight from Warsaw ... The indications were that air had escaped from
one of the doors _ the right door on the rear," Pilavakis told Greece's
state-run NET television.
</P>
<P>
Pilavakis, who said he resigned from the airline in January, gave six hours of
testimony to investigators in Cyprus who have seized maintenance records and
other documents from Helios.
</P>
<P>
Helios managing director Dimitris Pantazis insisted the plane had been
air-worthy.
</P>
<P>
"I understand the pain and grief felt across Cyprus," he said. "Safety was
always our first priority. This was never compromised for the sake of profit ...
We must stop speculation and let the experts do their work."
</P>
<P>
Autopsies have been performed on all 26 bodies identified by relatives. They
included those of co-pilot Pambos Haralambous and flight attendant Louiza
Vouteri, which were found close together and near the remains of the cockpit,
coroners Nikos Kalogrias and Fillipos Koutsaftis said. The autopsy results
showed all 26 were alive _ but not necessarily conscious _ when the plane went
down. Medical examiners are also testing for the possible presence of toxic
gases in the cabin.
</P>
<P>
Chris Yates, a British aviation analyst with Jane's Transport, said loss of
cabin pressure could have caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
"I think we're looking at pure depressurization," Yates said. The pilot "had
apparently reported to Larnaca that (the plane) had experienced an
air-conditioning problem. It seems the pilot decided that problem was not
sufficiently serious to warrant a return to Larnaca and continued the
journey."
</P>
<P>
He added that "depressurization could have left those on board alive, but
unconscious. There is scientific evidence to suggest that people who fall into
unconsciousness because of this sort of thing can remain alive for a
considerable length of time irrespective of the fact that the air supply is
limited."
</P>
<P>
The Helios jet crashed near the village of Grammatiko, 25 miles (40 kilometers)
north of Athens, after the plane plunged 10,400 meters (34,000 feet) into a
mountainous area.
</P>
<P>
Greek air force jets scrambled when the plane lost contact with air traffic
control had been escorting the plane. The fighter pilots reported seeing the
co-pilot slumped over the controls in the cockpit, apparently unconscious. There
was no sign in the cockpit of the pilot.
</P>
<P>
The plane's flight data recorder and the remains of the badly damaged voice
recorder will be examined in Paris.
</P>
<P>
In Cyprus, President Tassos Papadopoulos attended a church service on the island
to mark three days of national mourning. He said he was considering requesting
help from European investigators.
</P>
<P>
"We remain at the side of the grief-stricken families ... The government will
not stop at messages of condolence. Those responsible _ whoever they are _ will
be found," Papadopoulos said.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the victims visited the crash site near Athens for the first time
Tuesday to attend an outdoor memorial service, held beside the tail of the plane
_ one of the few remaining pieces of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday, 23 of the identified bodies were flown to Cyprus aboard a Greek
military transport plane. Many bodies of the 121 people aboard were burned in a
brush fire sparked by the crash and will be identified in Athens by DNA
comparison with close family members.
</P>
<P>
Marios Tsopanis, whose sister Christiana Douna was killed in the crash along
with her husband and three children, sobbed with grief.
</P>
<P>
"I just want to bring them home for the burial," he said. "It's the waiting that
so awful."
