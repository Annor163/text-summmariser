British pilots call for quick release of preliminary findings in Cypriot plane crash

<P>
The British pilots' union on Wednesday urged Greek authorities to quickly
release preliminary findings on the cause of the Cypriot plane crash that killed
121 people, and say some of the details about the flight's last minutes "just
don't add up."
</P>
<P>
The Helios Airways flight crashed Sunday, killing everyone on the plane. Greek
authorities are investigating whether something may have caused most of the
passengers and crew to lose consciousness, and if someone other than the pilot
and co-pilot may have tried to fly the aircraft in the moments before it
crashed.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are also investigating reports that the Boeing 737-300 had suffered
technical problems in the past. Initial theories had pointed to a catastrophic
loss of air pressure, which starved the crew and passengers of
oxygen.
</P>
<P>
"There have been several apparently conflicting reports and a number of
statements that just don't add up," Captain Mervyn Granshaw, head of the British
Airline Pilots' Association said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"There is a concern in our industry to learn, as quickly as possible, what
happened. ... If there is too much delay, the speculation will
increase."
</P>
<P>
Granshaw did not specify which reports conflicted and what their sources were.
But he mentioned what the pilots of two Greek air force jets said they saw in
the Cypriot airliner's cockpit when they flew alongside after the plane lost
radio contact.
</P>
<P>
The fighter pilots reported seeing the co-pilot slumped over in the cockpit,
apparently unconscious, and said the pilot was not in his seat. They said they
later saw two unidentified people in the cockpit, possibly trying to regain
control of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Greek authorities have refused to release more details while the investigation
is going on.
</P>
<P>
Granshaw said if there was a sudden loss of air pressure, pilots and passengers
would be affected similarly.
</P>
<P>
The passengers "may have managed to get on their oxygen masks, but it seems
inconceivable that they would have walked up to the cockpit, seen the pilots,
wrestled with the controls," Granshaw said.
</P>
<P>
He said allowing speculation to continue "wouldn't help the relatives, or our
industry."
</P>
<P>
The pilots' union represents more than 8,000 British pilots and flight
engineers. Granshaw did not immediately return a phone call seeking further
comment.
