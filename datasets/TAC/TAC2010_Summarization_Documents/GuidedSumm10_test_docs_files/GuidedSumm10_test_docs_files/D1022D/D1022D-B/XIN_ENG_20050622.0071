The International Whaling Commission
(IWC) on Wednesday defeated a Japanese proposal to expand its 
scientific whaling program by nearly doubling its annual catch of 
mink whales, which critics say is a commercial hunt in the guise 
of science.
</P>
<P>
The IWC member states voted 30 for and 27 against, with 1 
abstention, to support a non-binding resolution brought by 
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The resolution urged Japan to withdraw its proposal to expand 
its scientific whaling or revise it to ensure any scientific data 
it needs is obtained by non-lethal means.
</P>
<P>
Japan's plan to expand its research included nearly doubling 
its catch of minke whales from 440 to 850 a year and eventually 
hunting yearly 50 fin and humpback whales -- two endangered whales.
</P>
<P>
Australia, New Zealand and other anti-whaling states say Japan 
exploits a loophole in the 19-year-old ban on commercial whaling 
to hunt the giant mammals for food.
</P>
<P>
Japan is conducting research whaling under a clause in a 1986 
moratorium. It is campaigning for a full-scale return to 
commercial catches.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday at the IWC meeting, Japan's proposal to resume 
commercial whaling under regulations was defeated in a vote.
