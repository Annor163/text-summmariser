Australia says it may be short of support for continued whaling moratorium

<P>
Australia conceded Thursday it may be a few votes short of victory in a campaign
to extend a moratorium on commercial whaling at an international conference this
month.
</P>
<P>
But after lobbying tiny South Pacific island nations this week, Environment
Minister Ian Campbell said the Solomon Islands had vowed to abstain from voting
on an expected Japanese motion to end the commercial whaling
ban.
</P>
<P>
A separate push by Japan to expand its current research whaling program _ in
which hundreds of whales are killed each year _ will also be on the agenda of
the International Whaling Commission when it meets in Ulsan, South Korea, on
June 20-24.
</P>
<P>
Campbell has been leading an Australian push to block a resumption of commercial
whaling, and wants to turn the IWC into a conservation organization with the
establishment of a Southern Ocean whale sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
He has made a whirlwind visit to the Solomon Islands and the tiny island nations
of Kiribati and Tonga to make his case.
</P>
<P>
"I think the cold hard reality is that there is still one or two votes in this,
that will be the situation," he told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. "We
won't really know the answer until we get to Korea next week."
</P>
<P>
Campbell later said Japan risked a potential backlash from Australians if it
continues to push for increased whaling.
</P>
<P>
"The way Australians think about Japan will be colored by their (Japan's)
behavior on this issue and that is not something that the government takes
lightly," Campbell told reporters in the Western Australia capital,
Perth.
</P>
<P>
The United States has urged Japan to end its research whaling program and warned
that any expansion of the program would be unacceptable, the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration said this month. NOAA is the U.S. government's
scientific research and whale management agency.
</P>
<P>
NOAA spokesman Scott Smullen said Japanese whalers already kill about 800 of the
maritime mammals each year, and U.S. specialists have noted signs that a
significant increase is planned.
</P>
<P>
Japan began killing whales for what it describes as research in 1987 in the
Southern Ocean and in the North Pacific. Japan unilaterally issues itself an
annual quota of more than 800 whales including minke, sei, Bryde's and sperm
whales.
</P>
<P>
Australia and other anti-whaling countries condemn research whaling as a guise
for commercial whaling.
</P>
<P>
The commission banned commercial whaling in 1986, but countries such as Japan
and Norway still catch hundreds of whales each year and are hoping for
international support for plans to substantially expand their
hunts.
</P>
<P>
Pro-whaling countries are close to having a voting majority on the 57-member
commission for the first time since the commercial ban was imposed.
</P>
<P>
That raises the possibility that the commission might pass resolutions
supporting Japan's research whaling program, or the resumption of limited
commercial kills.
</P>
<P>
A complete lifting of the ban is unlikely, since that would require the approval
of three-fourths of the members.
