<P>
China is urging international 
community to well protect whales at this year's annual meeting 
held in Ulsan, the Republic of Korea, from May 27 to June 24.
</P>
<P>
"China is a non-whaling country. It has banned any whaling 
activities, including commercial whaling for years," said Meng 
Xianlin, an official with the Endangered Species Import and Export
Management Office under the Ministry of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
"We actually appeal the international community to strengthen 
the protection over whales, to ensure a sustainable development of
this world marine delicacy," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) will
vote on several resolutions including whether Japan could expand 
its whaling quota.
</P>
<P>
According to IWC regulations, three quarters of the vote is 
need to raise the quota.
</P>
<P>
"I hope China could participate in anti-whaling camp during 
this year's voting," said Zhang Li, the China country director of 
the International Foundation of Animal Welfare (IFAW).
</P>
<P>
China's voting delegation will come from the Ministry of 
Agriculture Bureau of Fishery, the director of which refused to 
comment on China's decision.
</P>
<P>
IWC now has 61 member countries including China, which banned 
commercial whaling in 1986. Commission regulations allow limited 
hunting in Japan and other countries in the name of scientific 
research.
</P>
<P>
Sources with IFAW show that three countries, Japan, Iceland and
Norway, have found ways around the worldwide whaling moratorium 
and have killed more than 20,000 whales. Roughly 1,400 more will 
die by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Yoshimasa Hayashi, a member of Japan's House of 
Councilors, said at a previous occasion in May that at least half 
of the commission's members were expected to back Japan to double 
its annual quota and expand the number of species permitted for 
hunting.
</P>
<P>
His remark has triggered a criticism from many countries, such 
as Australia, Britain, the United States and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Australian Environment Minister Ian Campbell said last month 
that he would seek a permanent ban on commercial whaling and an 
end to Japan's whaling for scientific purposes at Ulsan meeting.
</P>
<P>
Japan argues that whale hunting is part of its culture and the 
thriving whale population has been eating sizable fish stocks.
</P>
<P>
"Whale is not belong any country, it is the whole world's 
oceanic resource, so no country could decide solely to capture the
mammal," Zhang Li said.
