The International Whaling 
Commission on Wednesday condemned Japan's proposals to increase its 
research whaling programme and to extend it to two threatened 
species.
</P>
<P>
The commission voted by 30 to 27 in favour of an Australian 
proposal urging Japan to drop a plan to double its hunt from some 
440 minke whales a year and to include endangered fin whales and 
vulnerable humpbacks.
</P>
<P>
Conservationists immediately welcomed the result.
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted that a majority of countries have sent a powerful 
message to Japan that their whaling in the Southern Ocean is just 
not acceptable," Conservation Minister Chris Carter of co-sponsor 
New Zealand told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which conducts research whaling under a clause in a 1986 
moratorium is campaigning for a full-scale return to commercial 
catches. It says stocks have recovered sufficiently during the 
19-year ban to be sustainably harvested.
