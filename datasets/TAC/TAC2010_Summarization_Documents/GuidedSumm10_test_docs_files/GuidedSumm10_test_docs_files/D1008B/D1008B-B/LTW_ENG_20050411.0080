Chad Funkhouser, 18, did not awaken over the weekend to farm chores
in Rockingham County, Va., up at the headwaters of the Shenandoah
River. Instead, he and about two-dozen other members of Turner Ashby
High School's Future Farmers of America opened their eyes to a pink
and lavender dawn far downstream on Smith Island, Md., in the
Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
They were out on a boat early Saturday and worked hard all morning.
They tested the bay's sparkling but pollution-threatened waters. They
combed the eelgrass meadows for signs of rebounding life. And they
hauled crab pots and sorted crabs with a veteran Smith Island
waterman. All the while, they were making important connections
between life upstream and down, and farmers and waterfolk's shared
cultivation of nature.
</P>
<P>
In a way it is all farming, concluded Curt Newsome, 17. ``It's
completely different in some ways. In other ways, it's completely
alike,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The students are part of an innovative cooperative relationship
that has grown among farmers of Rockingham County, a major
agricultural powerhouse and poultry producer; the watermen and women
of Smith Island; and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The friendly exchange slowly is replacing the tension that existed
a decade ago between farmers and bay people. The contention centered
on agricultural pollution, which has received a good share of blame
for contributing to the nitrogen overload responsible for destroying
the historic breeding grounds of the bay's fish, crabs and oysters --
and the livelihoods of those who work the Chesapeake.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the farmers also said they were struggling. They weren't
the only ones at fault, they said, pointing to the big cities closer
to the bay and their overflowing sewage plants and coal-fired power
plants, and their burgeoning suburbs.
</P>
<P>
``Down here, they blame the farmers for the pollution,'' Newsome
said. ``Where we are, they blame the people down here.''
</P>
<P>
He has learned that lesson thanks to longtime Turner Ashby
agriculture teacher and FFA adviser Eric Fitzgerald, who helped start
the annual exchange more than a decade ago. At first, he arranged
meetings between farmers and watermen, then he began leading annual
school trips.
</P>
<P>
``There was kind of an adversarial relationship between the bay and
agriculture,'' he said. ``Some said, 'You don't want to go down there
with those doggone tree-huggers.' But it's been one of the best
things. The kids learn so much being around these guys.''
</P>
<P>
The project also has expanded the islanders' world, said Wes
Bradshaw, a retired waterman who works for the Chesapeake Bay
Foundation. On Saturday, he helped give the students a hands-on
crabbing lesson.
</P>
<P>
He hopes lessons about ecology -- and working together to save the
bay -- take root. ``It's going to take more than one group or
another,'' Bradshaw said. ``We've all got to pull together to make it
work.''
</P>
<P>
Some have said that the farmers and watermen are in a better place
to understand the work ahead than the 100,000 new residents who move
annually into the watershed.
</P>
<P>
Despite years of work, as much as 40 percent of the bay's deep
waters still lacks enough oxygen for crabs and fish on some summer
days. But if people understand the bay, they will want to save it,
Chesapeake Bay Foundation spokesman John Surrick said. And the best
way to understand the bay, he added, ``is to touch it. To feel it.''
</P>
<P>
Like the students, who spent their weekend exploring life on the
water and in the grass beds -- studying the crabs, the slender pipefish
that look like tiny straight seahorses, the oysters, the isopods, the
bay anchovies.
</P>
<P>
``The reason Smith Island has the best crabs in the world are these
grass beds,'' said Allyson Ladley, a Bay Foundation educator, as the
students crowded around her on the boat, bobbing in the bay.
``Hopefully, it will be a decent year for grasses.''
</P>
<P>
Remember, she said: ``Low nitrogen. Higher grass beds.''
</P>
<P>
Students such as Funkhouser already have grasped the lesson. ``All
farmers need to take precautions. And they have environmental
practices that 20 years ago, nobody would have thought of,'' he said.
``In our area, I hear it's better than it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
He and his classmates know the importance of fencing off streams to
prevent animals from polluting the water. They monitor the water
quality of a stream.
</P>
<P>
They have won a grant and are planting a buffer of grasses, shrubs
and trees to filter the runoff from a large poultry plant.
</P>
<P>
From that poultry plant, the students brought big ice-chests full
of chicken with them to Smith Island's town of Tylerton. They mixed up
big buckets of their special Rockingham County barbecue sauce. They
stoked a huge fire pit outside the firehouse. And in what has become
an annual tradition, they cooked up enough chicken for everyone in
town. Some students gathered daffodils and set the tables. The island
women brought salads and their famous multilayered Smith Island cakes.
</P>
<P>
Together, under the trees on windswept Smith Island, they feasted
and told stories. A pastor blessed the fleet of workboats. They prayed
for a waterman from a nearby island who was lost in a storm two weeks
ago. And they prayed for better days on the bay.
