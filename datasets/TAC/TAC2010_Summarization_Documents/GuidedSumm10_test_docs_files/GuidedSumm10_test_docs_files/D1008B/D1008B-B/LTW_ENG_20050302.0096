New Save-the-Bay Campaign Touts Chesapeake as Food Source

The television ad begins with water disappearing into
a storm drain as a voice warns that fertilizer put on lawns in the
spring can wind up in the bay. The ad next shows a blue crab lying
lifeless in the surf. ``No crab should die like this,'' the solemn
announcer says.
</P>
<P>
Then the announcer appears onscreen, carrying a small tub in one
hand and what appears to be a backfin lump in the other. ``They should
perish in some hot, tasty melted butter,'' he exclaims.

The federal Chesapeake Bay Program, trading its traditional appeals
to the conscience for a startling message aimed at the stomach, has
launched a series of TV spots, newspaper ads and billboards in the
Washington region that casts the bay first and foremost as a source of
seafood.
</P>
<P>
With the slogan ``Save the Crabs ... Then Eat 'Em,'' the campaign
aims to make residents see pollution as the equivalent of sneezing on
the buffet.
</P>
<P>
``The lunch you save may be your own,'' one newspaper ad says.
</P>
<P>
The ads were designed by Peter Mitchell, a marketing executive who
said he hopes to reach people the bay program has not during 20 years
of traditional environmentalism.
</P>
<P>
``We're saying you should protect the crabs because they're really
tasty,'' Mitchell said. ``We're not preaching to people, and I think
that's what's different about this.''
</P>
<P>
Though the ads already are running, the $600,000 campaign
officially kicked off Wednesday at -- where else -- a seafood
restaurant, Johnny's Half Shell in Washington.
</P>
<P>
There, with plates of fried oysters on the table, local chefs said
they had seen fish, crabs and oysters from the Chesapeake become
smaller and less plentiful in recent years.
</P>
<P>
``A lot of the crabmeat we get has to come from elsewhere, and it
doesn't really have that rich and sweet flavor'' that Chesapeake crabs
do, said Jamie Stachowski of Washington's Restaurant Kolumbia.
</P>
<P>
The campaign employs humor in the crab ad and in another TV spot
that dramatizes the choice between a lawn and seafood by showing a man
unhappily chomping on a sandwich of grass clippings, instead of crab
cake.
</P>
<P>
The ads say they're from the ``Chesapeake Club,'' but in fact, they
are sponsored by the bay program, a subsidiary of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency that oversees a massive bureaucracy of
state and federal programs.
</P>
<P>
The bay program generally is not accused of being edgy. In fact,
its usual outreach includes sending news releases on algae blooms and
sewage plants.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Conner, a program spokesman, said that strategy has had
limited success. It has induced people to worry about the bay -- one
recent survey showed about 90 percent of people in the watershed were
concerned about the bay's health -- but has not persuaded them to do
something about it.
</P>
<P>
``The trick is moving that concern over to action,'' Conner said.
</P>
<P>
After 18 months of surveys and planning, the bay program and
Mitchell's organization, the Washington-based Academy for Educational
Development, decided the trick was to sell the Chesapeake not as a
cause but as a menu item.
</P>
<P>
``There's two different approaches to try to change people. One is
religion and one is marketing,'' he said. ``We picked marketing.''
</P>
<P>
Conner said the ads would continue until April, the end of spring
fertilizing season. In the meantime, other environmentalists said they
were reserving judgment.
</P>
<P>
``I hope that the (viewers) don't think that the only reason to
save the bay ... is to eat from it,'' said Donald Boesch, president of
the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science.
