<HEADLINE> Suspect in Gay Attack Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>

	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- One of two young men charged in the slaying  
of gay college student Matthew Shepard pleaded guilty today and was 
sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Henderson, 21, a high school dropout and roofer, pleaded  
guilty to felony murder and kidnapping, avoiding a trial and the 
possibility of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Henderson and Aaron McKinney, 21, posed as  
homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar 
last October, kidnapped and pistol-whipped him and left him tied to 
a fence in the cold. The 21-year-old University of Wyoming student 
died five days later at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said he drove the truck and helped tie Shepard to the  
fence, but blamed McKinney for the beating. He said he tried to 
stop the beating, but McKinney struck him when he spoke up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matthew looked really bad, so I told (McKinney) to stop, he's  
had enough,'' Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson then apologized to Shepard's parents, Judy and Dennis:  
``I'm very sorry for what I did and I'm ready to pay my debt for 
what I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Jeffrey A. Donnell dismissed his apology.  
</P>
<P>
	``This court does not believe you feel any remorse,'' Donnell  
said when he sentenced him. ``The pain you have caused here, Mr. 
Henderson, will never go away. Never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson had been charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping  
and aggravated robbery in the beating death of Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	The crime led to demands for stronger hate-crime laws around the  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney will be tried in August on first-degree murder,  
kidnapping and aggravated robbery charges. He could be sentenced to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been speculation that if Henderson entered a plea, he  
would end up testifying against his friend and co-defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a plea bargain, the defense has to give something to  
the prosecution, such as his testimony against McKinney,'' said 
legal analyst Andrew Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Cal Rerucha opened jury selection by telling the  
prospective jurors that Shepard was ``not the same as you and I'' 
but that every individual should be treated equally under the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	But Henderson's attorney, Wyatt Skaggs, said his client merely  
watched while the other man delivered the fatal blows to Shepard. 
He also said the slaying was not premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's girlfriend is awaiting sentencing after pleading  
guilty Dec. 23 to accessory after the fact to murder. McKinney's 
girlfriend goes on trial in May on an accessory charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has moved to action activists on both sides of the gay  
rights issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, a dozen young people dressed as angels, with white  
sheets for wings, tried to block from view an anti-gay group 
demonstrating outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The angels stood silently, but inside their human wall about a  
dozen anti-gay demonstrators from Kansas shouted slogans and waved 
signs, including one that said ``God Hates Fags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These ... creatures are sending this nation to hell in a  
handbasket,'' said the Rev. Fred Phelps of Westboro Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps and members of his Westboro Baptist Church also picketed  
Shepard's funeral in Casper with anti-gay signs.
