   LARAMIE, Wyo. _ At sunrise on Sunday, the Rev. Stephen M.
Johnson and fellow worshippers will gather for an Easter service on
a bleak, windswept hill here.
</P>
<P>
   They will stand by a small cross of stones, a rough marker of
the spot where Matthew Shepard was beaten, robbed and left to die,
lashed to wooden fence poles.
</P>
<P>
   In the six months since the fatal beating of Shepard, a gay
21-year-old college student, the spot has become a pilgrimage site,
as people bearing poems and floral bouquets have worn deep ruts in
a dirt track to the lonely section of fence.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, as a chill wind blew, Johnson, a Unitarian minister,
reflected: ``I have seen people come out here with a pocketknife
and take a piece of the fence, like a relic, like an icon. To have
a piece of the experience here is powerful to people.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, six months to the day after Shepard was beaten and
abandoned here, these powerful emotions will be focused on the
granite Albany County Courthouse, where Russell A. Henderson, the
first of two defendants, is to go on trial on charges of
first-degree murder, kidnapping and robbery.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate trial in August, the other defendant, Aaron J.
McKinney, is to face trial on the same charges.
</P>
<P>
   In death, Shepard, who was a boyish, slightly built freshman at
the University of Wyoming, became an overnight symbol of violence
against gay people, inspiring hundreds of vigils and rallies and
countless discussions around the United States and around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Bracing for an enormous amount of news media interest in the
trial, the presiding state district judge, Jeffrey Donnell, has
banned television cameras and radio microphones from the courtroom,
set up a special area for protesters, tightened police security,
and ordered that the jury be sequestered after opening arguments.
</P>
<P>
   This tremendous interest has already become a theme of complaint
for Wyatt Skaggs, the court-appointed lawyer for Henderson, a
21-year-old who was working as a roofer when he was arrested on
Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   In December, when Cal Rerucha, the Albany County attorney,
announced that he would seek the death penalty in both cases,
Skaggs called the choice ``politically motivated,'' noting that
this would be Wyoming's first capital murder trial in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the defense lawyer told prospective jurors, ``We've
got to begin by disregarding the guilt thing, that we have to
punish somebody to show the nation we're not some dusty old cow
town.''
</P>
<P>
   Skaggs added, ``The press wants us to think that we are somehow
responsible for what went on Oct. 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the courtroom, Skaggs indicated that he would fight for
his client's life, but would not dispute his presence at the fence.
He conceded to juror candidates that the police had recovered a
jacket belonging to Henderson that was spattered with Shepard's
blood.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyer said that his client did not profit from the $20
robbery and did not participate in the pistol-whipping of Shepard,
who was 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighed 105 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew
Shepard,'' Skaggs said.
</P>
<P>
   As this university town of 30,000 people prepares for a trial
that is expected to last through April, gay organizers here and
around the nation are taking measure of the distance traveled since
Shepard's death was on front pages and magazine covers the world
over.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, many organizers are frustrated that widespread
horror over the murder never translated into political support for
hate-crime bills around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a gap between rhetoric and what politicians are
willing to do in terms of public policy,'' said Kerry Lobel,
executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a
gay rights group based in Washington. ``Nearly everyone expressed
their condolences. But condolences in an environment of hatred and
homophobia is cheap talk.''

<P>
   Thirteen state legislatures, including New York's, are debating
bills to raise penalties for crimes motivated by antigay bias. But
every hate-crime bill that went to a state legislature for a vote
this winter was defeated, including one in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, less than one month after Shepard died in a
hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., voters there rejected adding
``sexual orientation'' to a city antidiscrimination ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Baker-Easley, acting director of a local gay community
center, said, ``The knife through the heart was having people vote
the ordinance down as soundly as they did, by a larger proportion
than 10 years earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to stir interest in federal hate-crime legislation, Judy
Shepard, Matthew's mother, addressed a news conference in
Washington in late March.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no guarantee that these laws will stop hate crimes
from happening, but they can reduce them,'' said Mrs. Shepard, who
later traveled here for the trial from her home in Saudi Arabia,
where the family had moved for a job. ``They can help change the
climate in this country, where some people feel it is OK to target
specific groups of people and get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking beyond the recent political defeats, many antiviolence
organizers sense that the impact of Shepard's death was more
subtle. They say he gave a human face to antigay violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew Shepard humanized gay people _ he busted the
stereotypes,'' said Brian Levin, director of Stockton College's
Center on Hate and Extremism in Pomona, N.J. ``Gays were no longer
these leather-clad, flamboyantly dressed people from San Francisco.
It was the sweet kid next door.''
</P>
<P>
   David M. Smith, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay
political organization in Washington, summed it up this way:
``Matthew represented people's brother, people's son, people's best
friend. It all came together to touch people in a way that other
murders had not. It caused discussions to take place at dinner
tables across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard stamped a memorable face on a long-disguised problem of
bigotry toward gay people, said Kevin Jennings, executive director
of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting a change of heart in the heartland, requests for help
have poured in from school administrators around the country, said
Jennings, whose organization trains teachers and students in an
effort ``to end homophobia in K through 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from helping to set up a gay tolerance program in public
schools in Des Moines, Iowa, Jennings said Friday from New York:
``There has been a real jump when people in Iowa and Kansas City
realize that this is not simply a problem in New York and San
Francisco. If teachers in Des Moines or in Kansas City want to do
something, that is ultimately more important than legislation.
Legislation will follow.''
