	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Across the nation, small communities are  
finding that justice can be very expensive. Some prosecutors are 
deciding it's not worth it, especially for death penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In Laramie, where Russell Henderson is on trial for the beating  
death of gay college student Matthew Shepard, social service 
agencies could lose more than $100,000 unless the county can come 
up with a way to pay for prosecuting and defending Henderson and 
co-defendant Aaron McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
	The first phase of jury selection in Henderson's trial concluded  
Wednesday with the choice of 47 prospects, who will undergo a final 
round of questioning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jasper, Texas, Judge Joe Folk said it will take county  
taxpayers three years to pay for prosecuting two defendants in the 
dragging death of a black man and three other pending capital 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``This can bankrupt small counties. Some county judges have said  
they won't prosecute some capital murder cases and will go for just 
murder because of the cost of a trial,'' Folk said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Okanagan, Wash., the government was financially crippled  
prosecuting Juan Duarte Gonzalez, accused of killing a policeman. 
The case is expected to cost up to $1 million, 9 percent of the 
county's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The county responded by drastically cutting spending, including  
pay raises for its 350 employees. Gonzalez even has his own line in 
the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Pozner, president of the National Association of Defense  
Lawyers, said larger communities like Los Angeles are better able 
to absorb the costs of major prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``A big case in a small community can be prohibitive,'' Pozner  
said. ``But you have to make the communities responsible for 
prosecution. If you just gave them access to the state budget, 
everyone would want to do show trials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mid-sized communities aren't immune from the financial impact of  
a high-profile case either. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this year, Boulder, Colo., spent $1.2 million  
investigating the death of JonBenet Ramsey, and the district 
attorney spent another $400,000. No one has even been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	``The county has a limited budget and we're restricted by state  
law how much we can raise taxes. The prospect of paying for a 
multimillion-dollar trial is staggering. We have to come up with 
the money somewhere, and if that's the case, there's going to have 
to be some budget-cutting,'' said county spokeswoman Jana Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
	Pozner blamed prosecutors for driving up the costs in  
high-profile cases, saying they feel pressure to get more witnesses 
when the national media is looking over their shoulders. Pozner 
said defense attorneys are compelled to match prosecutors witness 
for witness, driving up the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	But former federal prosecutor William Pizzi, now a law professor  
at the University of Colorado, said it's not fair to blame just the 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm critical of the system as a whole,'' he said. ``We ought  
to be able to do this in a less expensive way, but it's hard to 
reform our system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pizzi said it is up to judges to keep expenses in check. He said  
costs could be trimmed by reforming pretrial procedures and rules 
of evidence.
