	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Two men who opposed the death penalty were  
dismissed as potential jurors in the first-degree murder trial of a 
man charged in the beating death of a gay college student. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen potential jurors were released Thursday from the trial  
of Russell Henderson, who faces the death penalty if convicted in 
the Oct. 6 attack on Matthew Shepard. More candidates were 
questioned today. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements are expected to begin April 6.  
</P>
<P>
	Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21, are accused of luring  
Shepard out of a bar, pistol-whipping him and tying him to a fence. 
The University of Wyoming student died a few days later. 
Authorities have said Shepard's sexuality was a factor in the 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men face murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery charges.  
McKinney will be tried in August. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney has been complaining about his treatment in the county  
jail. His attorneys have alleged that he is being treated more 
harshly than other inmates, that visitation by family members has 
been restricted and that he was denied athletic shoes his father 
attempted to drop off.
