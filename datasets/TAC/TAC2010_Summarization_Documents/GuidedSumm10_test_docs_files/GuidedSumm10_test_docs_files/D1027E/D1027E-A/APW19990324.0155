<HEADLINE> Trial in Wyo. Gay Slaying To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Police stepped up patrols today outside the  
courthouse for the trial of one of two men accused of murdering gay 
college student Matthew Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no protesters before the court session got under way,  
but authorities set aside areas for them during the trial of 
Russell Henderson, 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-gay protesters and gay rights advocates have clashed  
repeatedly over the Shepard case. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson is accused of pistol-whipping Shepard, lashing him to  
a fence in Wyoming's high plains and leaving him to die last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection was to begin today, with opening statements  
scheduled for April 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Osborn, who attended grade school with Shepard and remained  
his friend, stopped by the courthouse on his way to work to 
remember Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is: My friend is dead,'' Osborn said.  
``Matt was a person. He wasn't just a gay man. Nothing can bring 
him back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about having to endure the trials of the two murder  
suspects, Osborn said, ``It's going to be very difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson and his co-defendant, Aaron McKinney, 21, both face  
the death penalty if convicted in a case that has become a central 
focus for gay rights activists and others seeking stronger bias 
crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Shepard's mother asked Congress and state  
legislatures to enact bias crime laws to deter future acts of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no guarantee that these laws will stop hate crimes  
from happening. But they can reduce them,'' Judy Shepard said at a 
news conference in Washington, D.C. ``They can help change the 
climate in this country, where some people feel it is okay to 
target specific groups of people and get away with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shepard declined to discuss the trial, saying only that she  
and her husband ``want to allow justice to run its course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Henderson and McKinney, both high-school  
dropouts, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound 
Shepard out of a bar last October and then kidnapped and beat him. 
The political science major at the University of Wyoming died five 
days later at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney is scheduled to stand trial in August.  
</P>
<P>
	After the attack, Laramie found itself portrayed as a backwards,  
homophobic outpost of Wild West-style violence and 
small-mindedness. 
</P>
<P>
	Betty Hoover, a jury consultant based in Raleigh, N.C., said  
jurors may be eager to show that the people of Laramie, population 
26,000, are progressive, law-abiding folks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've got a small town where nothing like this has ever  
happened, then they are definitely going to do their best to 
portray that they care,'' she said. ``They don't want the world to 
think that's the type of thing that happens in their town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City spokesman Randy Vickers said police have set up fences to  
keep news reporters and demonstrators at bay, and access to the 
Albany County Courthouse has been limited to one door, where two 
metal detectors have been installed. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is expected to last five weeks.
