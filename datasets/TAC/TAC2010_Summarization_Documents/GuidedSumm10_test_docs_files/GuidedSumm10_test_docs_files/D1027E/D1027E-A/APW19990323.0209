	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The day before one of the men accused of  
killing her son was going on trial in Wyoming, the mother of gay 
college student Matthew Shepard lobbied tearfully for hate-crime 
laws that could deter future acts of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Her plea was seconded by a relative of James Byrd Jr., the black  
man who was chained to the back of a pickup truck last summer and 
dragged to his death over East Texas roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Shepard and Byrd nephew Daryl Verrett appeared at a  
Washington news conference organized by the Human Rights Campaign 
and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, urging Congress and 
state legislatures to enact new statutes against hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no guarantee that these laws will stop hate crimes  
from happening. But they can reduce them,'' Mrs. Shepard said 
haltingly, her statement punctuated by sobs. ``They can help change 
the climate in this country, where some people feel it is okay to 
target specific groups of people and get away with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her son, a University of Wyoming freshman, was pistol-whipped,  
lashed to a fence and left for dead last October. He died in a 
hospital five days later. The first of Shepard's two alleged 
attackers, Russell Henderson, goes on trial Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shepard declined to discuss the trial, saying only that she  
and her husband ``want to allow justice to run its course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Byrd's case, the first of three white men accused in his  
slaying, white supremacist John William King, was sentenced last 
month to death by lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's nephew took issue with Texas Gov. George W. Bush and  
others who question the need for special hate-crime statutes. Bush 
said Monday: ``People, when they commit a crime, have hate in their 
heart. I think it's hard to distinguish between one degree of hate 
or another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Verrett said hate crimes, unlike most other crimes, are  
meant to have impact beyond the immediate victim. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hate crimes are done to send a message of terror to persons of  
different color, religious beliefs, sexual orientations, ethnicity, 
nationality or etc.,'' Verrett said. ``The message is if you are in 
any way like this individual, you are hated, you are subhuman, you 
have no right to be on this earth, and if possible, all people like 
you should be exterminated from this earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The savagery of the Shepard and Byrd slayings horrified the  
nation, giving new impetus to consideration of hate-crimes laws in 
Washington and state capitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Measures pending in Congress would make federal prosecution of  
hate crimes easier and would expand existing statutes, allowing the 
Justice Department to prosecute crimes that were based on a 
person's sex, sexual orientation or disability. Now, the statute 
only covers crimes based on race, color, religion or national 
origin. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 states have hate crimes laws, but only 21 cover  
sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some congressional Republicans have suggested the legislation is  
unnecessary because state laws protect the groups identified in the 
bill. And some social conservatives bridle at what they view as 
special protections for homosexuals.
