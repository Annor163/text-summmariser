	CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) -- The trial for one of two men accused in  
the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard 
has been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Jeffrey A. Donnell moved the start of the trial for  
Russell Arthur Henderson from March 22 to April 6 due to a 
scheduling conflict involving one of the attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard died following a brutal beating in Laramie in October.  
Police have said the attack was motivated in part because he was 
gay. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson and Aaron James McKinney, both 21, are charged with  
murder and face the death penalty if convicted. McKinney's trial is 
set for Aug. 9.
