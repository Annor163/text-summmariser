 &HT;    Floyd lashes out toward Bahamas; Southeast keeps watch

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Hurricane Floyd got stronger and headed
toward the Bahamas Saturday, packing 110 mph winds and leaving
weather pundits wondering whether it will hit South Florida this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Water managers and county emergency workers were on alert, while
some anxious people in Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast
stocked up on storm supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that Floyd was
expected to intensify today, becoming a Category 3 hurricane, and
it could become a Category 4 with sustained winds of at least 131
mph by Tuesday afternoon, when it's expected to reach the northern
Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a strong hurricane,'' said meteorologist
Edwin Campos. ``The whole thing is where it's going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd whirred away from the Caribbean's Leeward Islands on
Saturday, but forecasters warned that Puerto Rico and the Virgin
Islands could be hit by heavy rains and flooding. The hurricane
itself was likely to pass well north of the islands, meteorologists
said.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. Saturday, Floyd was centered about 335 miles northeast
of Puerto Rico's capital, San Juan. It was expected to move
west-northwest at 12 mph.
</P>
<P>
   While forecasters say they can't predict where Floyd will go
after Tuesday, they said Floyd's center could reach the East Coast
by Thursday at its current speed. Residents could experience its
wind and rain much sooner. Tropical-force winds extend 175 miles
from the center, while hurricane gales reach out 105 miles, the
hurricane center said.
</P>
<P>
   If the hurricane keeps on the predicted course, a citizen's
information line could be activated as early as today, said Bill
O'Brien, Palm Beach County's emergency management director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing the same thing as everyone else: We're watching
it,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross is ready to open 11 shelters in Palm
Beach County, including one for people who need breathing
equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there have been no special water releases from
canals, said Ann Overton, a spokeswoman for the South Florida Water
Management District.
</P>
<P>
   The district's two meteorologists were working staggered shifts
this weekend to watch the storm, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Area grocery stores reported a small run on nonperishables, but
grocery managers are anticipating a crush on such items in the next
couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, it's happening already _ started this morning,''
said Fred Price, manager of the Publix on Village Boulevard in West
Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The store sold 550 1-gallon water jugs Saturday. ``If it keeps
coming like it is now, we'll get hit hard,'' Price said. ``It will
be outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Line, manager of a Winn-Dixie in Stuart, plans to order
extra nonperishables today after a run Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a couple of hours it was pretty wild in here today,'' he
said. ``We'll order heavy on those items tomorrow, because the next
truck won't come until Tuesday and if it's coming it'll be in full
swing by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardware stores were ordering more hurricane supplies as a
precaution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had several calls today asking about plywood, anchor
screw and other items, asking if we had any readily available,''
said Donald Chamberlain, a salesman at the Home Depot on Lake Worth
Road. ``But there's been no real noticeable rush yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Boca Raton's residents may be less concerned. ``We haven't
gotten any calls at all today,'' a Home Depot employee there said.
``No one's really thinking ahead.''
