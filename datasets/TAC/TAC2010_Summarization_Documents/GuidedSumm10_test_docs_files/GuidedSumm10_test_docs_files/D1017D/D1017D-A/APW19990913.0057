	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd strengthened to a very  
dangerous Category 4 storm today with 155 mph wind, surprising 
forecasters and charging toward the Bahamas on a path that also 
threatened the Florida coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rain started falling in parts of the Bahamas today as  
residents scrambled for emergency supplies, shelters opened, 
schools closed and shop owners boarded up windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandatory evacuations were ordered in exposed coastal areas of  
both the Bahamas and Florida's Brevard County. Workers also started 
leaving NASA's Kennedy Space Center, on a barrier island standing 
only 9 feet above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never been this scared about a storm,'' said Bahamas  
resident Angel Chea, manager of a graphics shop, as she boarded up 
her windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need people to get ready right now, not tonight, not  
tomorrow,'' said Joan Heller, a spokeswoman for Brevard County. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of uncertainty about the huge storm's path, a hurricane  
watch area on the mainland was expanded today, reaching all the way 
from the Miami area northward into Georgia, the U.S. National 
Hurricane Center said in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's capable of almost catastrophic destruction,'' said Todd  
Kimberlain, a forecaster at the hurricane center. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd had top sustained wind today of nearly 155 mph. That put  
it on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm, which features top 
sustained wind of more than 156 mph and is capable of causing 
extreme damage. By comparison, Hurricane Andrew had Category 4 
status when it struck south Florida in 1992, killing 26 people and 
causing an estimated $25 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the hurricane center said little additional  
strengthening was likely by midday Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two Category 5 hurricanes have struck the United States  
since record-keeping began, the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, which 
destroyed the railroad connecting the Florida Keys to the mainland 
and killed 423 people, and Camille in 1969, which killed 256 people 
along the Gulf Coast and in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	If Floyd continued on a track toward central Florida, NASA  
planned to shut down the Kennedy Space Center by midnight tonight, 
leaving none of its 12,500 workers behind to ride out the storm. 
The center is only 9 feet above sea level, so a storm surge as well 
as wind could be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	All four space shuttles were in hangars, but four  
multimillion-dollar rockets were on launch pads and couldn't be 
moved. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the northwest and central Bahamian islands were under  
hurricane warnings today. A tropical storm warning was posted for 
the southeastern Bahamas and the nearby British Turks and Caicos 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane watch on the mainland was extended from the Miami  
area northward all the way to near Brunswick, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of the watch area, Florida's Brevard County  
ordered tens of thousands of people living in mobile homes and 
coastal areas to evacuate beginning at 4 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are different tracks that have been projected and we  
don't come out unscathed on any of them,'' said Brevard County 
spokeswoman Joan Heller. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m., Floyd's center was about 90 miles east of San  
Salvador in the central Bahamas, and about 470 miles east-southeast 
of Miami. It was headed west at nearly 15 mph, and was expected to 
gradually turn to a west-northwesterly-heading by evening, with a 
further turn toward the northwest on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane-force wind extended 105 miles from its center with  
tropical storm-force wind stretching outward up to 290 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters estimated storm surge conditions could reach 15 to  
20 feet for the northwest Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd grew unexpectedly into a monster of a storm on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect such a very fast intensification,'' said Jerry  
Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center. ``This is a 
real surprise for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Far out at sea, Gert strengthened into a hurricane today with  
sustained wind increasing to 75 mph. At 11 a.m. EDT, Gert's center 
was about 1,400 miles east of the Leeward Islands. It was moving 
toward the west at nearly 20 mph.
