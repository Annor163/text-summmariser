	THE VALLEY, Anguilla (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd on Saturday whirred  
away from the Caribbean's Leeward Islands, but forecasters warned 
that Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could be hit by heavy rains 
and flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane itself was likely to pass well north of the  
islands, meteorologists said. Floyd was expected to intensify, and 
it was unlikely to hit land soon. 
</P>
<P>
	It posed no immediate threat to the United States coast. Still,  
it was recommended that people along the U.S. southeast monitor the 
storm's course this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's not going to threaten any land anywhere over the  
weekend,'' said Stacy Stewart, a meteorologist at the National 
Hurricane Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Caribbean islands canceled tropical storm watches Friday  
night as Floyd, packing winds of 110 mph, moved further out to sea, 
the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 p.m. Saturday, Floyd was centered about 335 miles northeast  
of Puerto Rico's capital, San Juan, at latitude 22.7 north and 
longitude 63.5 west. It was expected to move west-northwest at 12 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane-force winds extended about 105 miles from the storm's  
center, and tropical storm force winds extended another 175 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	In Anguilla, the government closed schools Friday and residents  
put up hurricane shutters, in case the storm veered in their 
direction. Ports and airports remained open. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on what I saw, the people are taking this thing serious.  
They are shopping mostly for dry foods and batteries, which are 
essential during a hurricane,'' said Lee Brooks, manager of a 
supermarket in The Valley, capital of the British island. 
</P>
<P>
	It was too early to tell if the storm would threaten the  
Bahamas, which lie far north of other Caribbean islands. Floyd was 
expected to be east of the Bahamas in about three days.
