	CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) -- Calling Hurricane Floyd ``one  
of the most serious hurricanes ever to threaten the United 
States,'' President Clinton issued disaster declarations for 
Florida and Georgia in anticipation of the destruction the storm 
may wreak on the southeastern U.S. coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The president issued the declarations Wednesday morning before  
leaving Queenstown for Christchurch for a state visit with New 
Zealand Prime Minister Jane Shipley. He planned to return home 
immediately after that visit to oversee emergency efforts for the 
storm, which he called ``one of the most serious hurricanes ever to 
threaten the United States, if the predictions of its force and 
scope hold true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask all of you here to remember my fellow Americans,''  
Clinton said. ``I am going to fly home, and we'll make the best job 
of it that we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The early declaration ``enables state and local governments to  
get equipment and other things ... in place to begin recovery 
efforts at the earliest possible moment,'' White House spokesman 
Barry Toiv said in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke twice Wednesday with James Lee Witt, the director  
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to keep abreast of 
Hurricane Floyd's progress. He also consulted with Vice President 
Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Witt and Gore placed a conference call to the governors and  
other state officials of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South 
Carolina to give them the most up-to-date forecast data on Floyd's 
likely path, a White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. EDT, Floyd's center was near Abaco Island, or about  
195 miles east-southeast of Palm Beach, Fla. It was moving 
west-northwest about 14 mph and was expected to turn gradually 
toward the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2 million coastal residents in Florida and Georgia have  
been urged to leave their homes for safe haven. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Gore communicated the declarations directly to the  
governors of Florida and Georgia, according to administration 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive storm also prompted Clinton to cut short a day of  
rest planned for Hawaii on the way back from New Zealand, where he 
had attended the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. 
</P>
<P>
	By canceling the Hawaii visit, Clinton will be back in  
Washington on Wednesday night, instead of Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president wants to return quickly to stay on top of the  
hurricane developments,'' said Clinton spokesman Jake Siewert. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has made a practice of visiting the sites of major  
disasters to review relief operations and comfort victims. But such 
visits often are delayed until the logistics of the president's 
visit won't interfere with relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration allows FEMA to begin supporting state and local  
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize and  
provide ... equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the 
impacts of the disaster,'' according to the announcement from the 
White House.
