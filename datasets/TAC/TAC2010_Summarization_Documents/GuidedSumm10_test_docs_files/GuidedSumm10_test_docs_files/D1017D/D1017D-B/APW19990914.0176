<HEADLINE>  Hurricane Floyd Menaces Bahamas </HEADLINE>

	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Panicked Bahamas residents abandoned  
beachfront homes and scrambled for emergency supplies Monday as 
mammoth Hurricane Floyd's 155 mph winds bore down on the 
vulnerable, low-lying archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy winds and rain pelted the Bahamian capital of Nassau. It  
was moving on a path that could deliver Florida its hardest storm 
strike in years by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm reportedly lashed San Salvador and Cat Island in the  
eastern section of the 600-mile chain of more than 700 islands. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nassau, strong winds rocked moving cars and kicked up sand  
and surf that delighted some die-hards still frolicking in the 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never been this scared about a storm,'' said shopkeeper  
Angel Chea as she hastily boarded up her windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm, which  
features top sustained winds of 156 mph with higher gusts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's capable of almost catastrophic destruction,'' said Todd  
Kimberlain, a forecaster at the U.S. National Hurricane Center. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, Hurricane Andrew was a Category 4 storm when it  
struck South Florida in 1992, killing 26 people and causing an 
estimated $25 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's eye was likely to pass over Eleuthera Island at 4 a.m.,  
meteorologists said -- but residents there were feeling the effect 
by early evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's fruit flying all over the place, and it's already  
uprooted small trees in my garden,'' said Geoff Pearce of 
Eleuthera, before phone lines there went silent. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Nassau residents were already in hurricane shelters.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be caught in the rush,'' said Margaret Bastian  
of Nassau, as she settled into a shelter with a blanket, a pillow 
and a small bag full of food. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm interrupted airline flights, cruises and shipping  
traffic between the United States and the Caribbean. American 
Airlines on Monday canceled its nine daily flights between southern 
Florida and its hub in San Juan, Puerto Rico, while both Carnival 
Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines sent Bahamas-bound 
ships to Mexico instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahamian officials warned that storm surges of up to 20 feet  
could sweep as far as six miles inland. That's a terrifying 
prospect on this island of New Providence, which is only seven 
miles from north to south. 
</P>
<P>
	``God is the only one who can help us now,'' said Nassau  
resident Mildred Minnis. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the northwest and central Bahamian islands were under  
hurricane warnings Monday night, as was all of the mainland Florida 
east coast from Florida City to just south of Brunswick, Georgia. 
Tropical storm warnings were posted for the southeastern Bahamas, 
the nearby British Turks and Caicos islands and parts of the 
Florida Keys. A hurricane watch was in effect for the Georgia coast 
from Brunswick to Savannah and is expected to be extended to South 
Carolina in the night. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nassau, the Bahamian capital, long lines formed at gasoline  
stations and grocery stores and two major supermarkets ran out of 
bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahamian schools were converted into hurricane shelters, and  
officials planned to close Nassau's airport later Monday. 
Organizers canceled a parade to welcome home Bahamian track runners 
from the Outdoor World Championship in Seville, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't ask those girls to come from a safe place to an  
unsafe place,'' said Sports Minster Zhivargo Laing. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Salvador, a quiet resort island where Christopher  
Columbus is believed to have first landed in the New World, Riding 
Rock Inn manager Carter Williams said he moved all of his guests to 
a shelter at the nearby Church of God. ``I worked until about 2 
o'clock (a.m.) preparing for the hurricane,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	The island's Club Med resort said some customers would wait out  
the storm at the resort. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 a.m. EDT, Floyd's center was 53 miles east of Eleuthera  
Island in the northwest Bahamas, which is 320 miles southeast of 
Miami. The National Weather Service in Miami reported the center at 
latitude 24.9 degrees north, longitude 75.3 degrees west. 
</P>
<P>
	It was moving west at 14 mph, but was expected to turn slightly  
northward later, cutting across the Bahamas and then arcing along 
the Florida peninsula beginning Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said the hurricane would likely rake across the Abacos  
Islands and Eleuthera, which were blasted last month by Hurricane 
Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was joined Monday by Hurricane Gert, which grew from a  
tropical storm to a hurricane with winds near 85 mph about 1,210 
miles east of the Leeward Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters were also watching a strengthening cluster of storms  
about 800 miles southeast of Bermuda and said it could become a 
tropical depression or storm.
