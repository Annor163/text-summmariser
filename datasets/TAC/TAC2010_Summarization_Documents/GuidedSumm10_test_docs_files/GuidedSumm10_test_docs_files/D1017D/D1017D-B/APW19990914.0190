	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd pounded the Bahamas with  
howling winds and blinding rain today, snapping palm trees in half, 
downing power lines and churning up dangerous surf throughout the 
vulnerable islands east of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Frightened residents in the low-lying archipelago huddled inside  
their homes and dozens of public shelters as Floyd, with top 
sustained wind of 150 mph, raked the Bahamas and threatened Florida 
and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting rocked,'' said JAMZ radio news director Kirk  
Smith, who reported 100 mph wind gusts in Nassau, the Bahamian 
capital. ``We tried to go outside but a huge tree just fell outside 
our studio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 a.m. EDT, Floyd's center was near Eleuthera Island and  
about 255 miles east of Miami. It was moving west-northwest near 14 
mph, and a gradual turn toward the northwest was expected later 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd uprooted 30-foot trees, ripped awnings off buildings and  
sent whirling sheets of rain through Nassau's deserted streets. Its 
roaring winds shook the 11-story Marriott Hotel and pelted the 
streets with debris, setting off car alarms. Love 97 radio reported 
flooding in the western tip of New Providence Island, which has 
165,000 people, half the country's population. 
</P>
<P>
	With one exception -- a man who watched the hurricane from a seat  
on his 8th-floor balcony -- stranded tourists huddled inside the 
underground ballroom at the Marriott. They slept on couches and the 
floor, sipped coffee and listened in awe to the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids slept through it and so did my husband, but I was  
woken by what sounded like tin crashing down and got worried when I 
could feel the whole bed shaking,'' said Jeannine Bixby of Rumney, 
N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2,000 guests and 500 staff members at the sprawling  
Atlantis Resort in Paradise Island were waiting out the storm 
inside a resort convention center. ``Everyone's really cooperative. 
They know how serious this is,'' said resort spokesman Ed Fields. 
</P>
<P>
	San Salvador, Eleuthera and Cat islands reported 110 mph winds  
today. The U.S. National Hurricane Center cited reports of severe 
damage in Eleuthera, but Bahamas police Chief Superintendent Alan 
Gibson said there were no immediate reports of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 600 miles wide, Floyd dwarfed the small islands, its  
hurricane-force winds extending 125 miles from the storm's center. 
Tropical storm-force winds extended 165 miles beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was expected to cut across the Bahamas and then arc along  
the Florida peninsula Wednesday. The huge storm could deliver 
Florida its hardest storm strike in years. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was in effect from Florida City, Fla., to  
just south of Brunswick, Ga. A hurricane watch was in effect 
northward to Little River Inlet, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	With evacuations planned or under way in parts of Florida and  
Georgia, the U.S. hurricane center issued a heavy surf advisory for 
the East Coast northward to Montauk Point, N.Y. Up to 10 inches of 
rain and dangerous storm surges were likely in the Bahamas, and 
tropical storm force winds were expected in Miami and Fort 
Lauderdale today. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm, which  
features top sustained wind of 156 mph with higher gusts. By 
comparison, Hurricane Andrew had Category 4 status when it struck 
South Florida in 1992, killing 26 people and causing an estimated 
$25 billion in damage. Andrew killed four people in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Rolle, a forecaster at the Bahamas Department of  
Meteorology, said the storm's center passed over Arthur's Town on 
north Cat Island earlier today. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials expected storm surges up to 20 feet and warned they  
could flood areas of New Providence six miles inland -- a daunting 
prospect for an island seven miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotels moved guests out of seaside rooms, and schools were  
converted into hurricane shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Debbie Cappell and her husband, of New York City, arrived in  
Nassau on Monday and planned to ride out the storm at their hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We only heard about (the storm) on the way to the airport. We  
had cancellation insurance, but we decided to take a chance,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Salvador, a quiet resort island where Christopher  
Columbus is believed to have first landed in the New World, Riding 
Rock Inn manager Carter Williams moved all of his guests to a 
shelter at the nearby Church of God. The island's Club Med resort 
said some customers were waiting out the hurricane at the resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd disrupted airline flights, cruises and shipping traffic  
between the United States and the Caribbean. American Airlines 
canceled its nine daily flights between southern Florida and its 
hub in San Juan, Puerto Rico, while both Carnival Cruise Lines and 
Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines sent Bahamas-bound ships to Mexico 
instead. Bahamas Air flew its jets to Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Hurricane Gert strengthened to winds near 105 mph and  
was 1,155 miles east of the Leeward Islands. Gert was moving 
west-northwest near 15 mph.
