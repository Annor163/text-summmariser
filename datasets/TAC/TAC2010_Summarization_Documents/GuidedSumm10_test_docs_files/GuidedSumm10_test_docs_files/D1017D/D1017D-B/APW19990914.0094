<HEADLINE> Hurricane Prompts Shinn Mistrial </HEADLINE>

	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd prompted a judge to  
declare a mistrial Tuesday in the lawsuit accusing Charlotte 
Hornets owner George Shinn of sexually assaulting a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Costa M. Pleicones initially delayed proceedings for  
several hours, then declared a mistrial and set the retrial for 
Dec. 6. He also urged both sides to try to reach a settlement 
before then. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Shinn and Leslie Price, the woman suing him,  
immediately went into the judge's chambers and were not available 
to discuss whether a settlement was possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Price says Shinn lured her to his suburban Tega Cay home in  
September 1997 and forced her to give him oral sex. Shinn has 
denied the allegations and has sued Price for slander in a North 
Carolina court. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for both sides had asked Pleicones to delay the  
proceedings to prevent having a long time between opening 
statements and testimony if the hurricane knocked out power or did 
a lot of damage in Columbia. In 1989, Hurricane Hugo knocked out 
power to parts of the city for up to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Pleicones said he was reluctant to declare the mistrial because  
of the money and time spent to get the case to trial, but he also 
said he would not put people in harm's way while the governor was 
ordering an evacuation of the coast about 100 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd is expected to hit the coast Thursday and, Pleicones said,  
``Clearly, this trial is not going to be concluded by Thursday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the case returns for trial, Pleicones will have to rule on  
several pretrial questions. That includes whether testimony will be 
allowed from a former Hornets cheerleader who has said Shinn 
coerced her into a two-year sexual relationship or from a man who 
says he had a sexual relationship with Price at the same time as 
the alleged assault by Shinn.
