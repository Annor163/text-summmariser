   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Floyd tore a destructive path through the western
Bahamas on Tuesday, packing 140 mph winds and 25 foot seas. By
Tuesday afternoon, it became increasingly clear that the storm was
heading on a more northerly track, alleviating the threat to
southern Florida, and putting areas farther north at greater risk
for landfall.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Floyd will take aim on the Southeast Coast, possibly
making landfall very late in the day. As a result, heavy rain will
batter the Georgia and Carolina coasts, with locally more than 5
inches of rain possible. In addition, heavy surf will cause
extensive beach erosion and flooding, especially toward evening.
While the precise path of Floyd is unknown, it is probable that
parts of the Carolina coastline will endure winds over 100 miles an
hour before Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Showers will form well to the north of Floyd near the Northeast
Coast as humid air is drawn inland from the Atlantic. Farther west,
the interior Northeast and Middle Atlantic states will remain
partly sunny and dry. Expansive high pressure building south from
central Canada will promote ample sunshine and cool conditions from
the Great Lakes to the Ohio Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers will accompany a jet stream disturbance
crossing the Southwest. A few of these showers will extend into
western Texas and the southeast Plains toward evening. The
remainder of the West will be mainly sunny and tranquil with
morning low clouds shrouding parts of the Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Night Blindness
</P>
<P>
   As Hurricane Floyd menaces the East Coast this week,
meteorologists will be blinded each night when, for two hours, the
satellite that serves North America loses power. During that time,
from the point of view of the satellite, there is a solar eclipse.
The solar-powered satellite is in a geostationary orbit 22,500
miles over the eastern Pacific. Each year around the spring and
autumn equinoxes, the Earth passes between the satellite and the
Sun. This limited data loss is not a major problem, since aircraft,
radar and other ground-based weather observations help fill the
void.
