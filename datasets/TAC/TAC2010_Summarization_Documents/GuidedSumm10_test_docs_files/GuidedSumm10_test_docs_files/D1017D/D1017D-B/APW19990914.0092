<HEADLINE> Floyd Chases PBS Show From Studio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd has chased PBS's ``Nightly  
Business Report'' from its studio. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial news show originates from WPBT in Miami and is  
broadcast on most PBS stations on weekdays. But WPBT's offices were 
closed Tuesday because of the approaching hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's show was to originate instead from New York, where  
``Nightly Business Report'' generally has a reporter in a studio 
each night.
