<HEADLINE> Vietnam Undertakes Nation-wide Census of Agent Orange Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam decided to undertake next
month a nation-wide census of Agent Orange victims, Vietnam's
English daily Vietnam News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The results of the census are intended to be used by the
Vietnamese government to work out more relevant policies for the
well-being of victims, and to call for stronger support from
domestic organizations and international assistance for victims.
</P>
<P>
During the Vietnam war, the Americans sprayed 42 million liters
of toxic chemicals, most of it Agent Orange, said Vietnam News,
adding that the victims include people who lived and worked in
areas sprayed between 1961 and 1971 southwards of the 17th
parallel.
</P>
<P>
Congenital deformity and disability caused by exposure to the
toxic chemical during the war can be found even in the second
generation of people directly exposed to it, said the daily.
</P>
<P>
Its effects on humans include cancer and skin disease, as well
as congenital deformities and disabilities, while causing
widespread environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Vietnam's Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and
Social Affairs believe more victims now live in Vietnam's central
and northern provinces than the south, with some families in
central Vietnam having three to five affected children.
</P>
<P>
The census will be implemented in all the 10,300 villages in
the country and be completed by July, an official of Vietnam's
Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs said.
