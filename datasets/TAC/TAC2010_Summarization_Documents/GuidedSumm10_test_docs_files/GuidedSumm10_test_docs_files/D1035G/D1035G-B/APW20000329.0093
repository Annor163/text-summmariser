<HEADLINE> Herbicide Linked to Diabetes  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Air Force study of veterans who sprayed
Agent Orange during the Vietnam War found the strongest evidence to
date that exposure to the herbicide is associated with diabetes,
officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   A 47 percent increase in diabetes was detected in those veterans
with the highest levels of dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   The lead investigator, Joel Michalek of the Air Force surgeon
general's office, was scheduled to release the findings at a
Pentagon news conference today.
</P>
<P>
   An outline of the results of the study -- which was based on 1997
physical examinations of 1,000 Air Force veterans -- was made
available to The Associated Press after the findings were reported
in today's editions of The Washington Post and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Today's report, which compared the health of exposed veterans
with 1,300 other Vietnam veterans who had no contact with Agent
Orange, said that as dioxin levels in the body increased, the
presence and severity of adult diabetes increased.
</P>
<P>
   Dioxin is the component of Agent Orange linked to many health
effects in laboratory animals.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bernard Sanders, I-Vt., a member of the House Government
Reform Committee that oversees veterans affairs, said the Air Force
findings confirm a diabetes link that many people have long
suspected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given this latest evidence, the federal government must
acknowledge the suffering of Vietnam veterans with diabetes and
provide them with compensation to which they are entitled,''
Sanders said today.
</P>
<P>
   The report said it found no consistent evidence that Agent
Orange is related to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It also found that exposed veterans experienced a 26 percent
increase in heart disease, although the rate did not increase as
dioxin levels increased. In a related finding, the report said that
instances of high blood pressure among the 1,000 veterans did
increase with higher levels of dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the report are being reviewed by the National
Academy of Sciences. The Academy will report to the Department of
Veterans Affairs to inform decisions on compensation to victims.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to Congress earlier this month, Michalek called the
Air Forcd study ''one of the best epidemiological studies ever
conducted.'' The study was started in 1981 and the first physical
examinations of exposed Air Force veterans were done a year later.
The work is to be completed in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam Veterans of America and other groups have criticized
the study as being too small and they have accused the Air Force of
being too secretive about its findings and too slow to make them
available to other researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, said that veterans needing health
compensation have benefited little from thze study, known as the
Ranch Hand study, named after the spraying operation in Vietnam.
