<HEADLINE> Retired Navy Chief Has Surgery </HEADLINE>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., the retired Navy admiral  
who commanded American naval forces in the Vietnam War and later 
became the Navy's top officer, was in critical condition Friday at 
Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C., after undergoing 
cancer surgery, a friend said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zumwalt, 78, was discovered on Sept. 24 to have a cancerous  
tumor in his chest cavity. He underwent eight hours of surgery on 
Wednesday at Duke and is in the intensive care unit there, retired 
Rear Adm. Bill Thompson said in a telephone interview. One of 
Zumwalt's lungs was removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson is a longtime friend of Zumwalt, who is a native of  
Tulare, Calif., and was the Navy chief of operations from 1970 to 
1974 while Thompson headed the Navy information office at the 
Pentagon.

<P>
	Thompson said doctors at Duke told him they are guardedly  
optimistic that Zumwalt will recover. Zumwalt's cancer is commonly 
associated with exposure to asbestos, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He continues his good spirits and humor,'' Thompson said,  
adding that President Clinton had called Zumwalt and that former 
President Bush had sent him a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Zumwalt, who headed American naval forces in Vietnam in 1968-69,  
is a renowned figure in the Navy and has remained active in a 
variety of pursuits since his retirement from the military. Last 
year, Clinton presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, 
the nation's highest civilian award, in part for his work on behalf 
of a foundation that seeks bone marrow donors for cancer victims. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Zumwalt's sons, Elmo R. Zumwalt III, died of cancer  
apparently linked to his exposure during the Vietnam War to the 
herbicide Agent Orange.
