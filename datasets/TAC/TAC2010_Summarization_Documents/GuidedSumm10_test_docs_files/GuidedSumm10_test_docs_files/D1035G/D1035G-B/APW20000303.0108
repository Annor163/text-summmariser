   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Vietnam has an estimated 1 million victims
of Agent Orange, the toxic defoliant widely used by U.S. forces
during the Vietnam War, according to the Vietnamese vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh said the United States should
take responsibility for resolving the issue, the official
English-language Vietnam News reported Thursday. Washington and
Hanoi have been talking about an agreement to allow the two
countries to share research on effects of the defoliants.
</P>
<P>
   The victims include war veterans, their offspring and civilians
living in affected areas. Vietnam has a population of about 76
million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another official said Friday that special funds set
up for victims of the Agent Orange have raised some $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   International and local organizations and individuals have
contributed $200,000 for the Central Fund for Agent Orange Victims
and $500,000 for programs in 45 provinces since their establishment
in late 1998, said Pham Thanh of the Central Fund.

<P>
   Prime Minister Phan Van Khai last month signed a decision,
retroactive to Jan. 1, to provide monthly allowances to government
workers, soldiers and volunteers working or fighting in areas that
were sprayed in August 1961-April 1975 and their disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   The allowances range from $3.4 to $7 depending on the
seriousness of their illness or disability.
</P>
<P>
   A survey on victims of toxic chemicals sprayed by U.S. forces
during the war was completed last year, but the results have not
been released yet.
</P>
<P>
   Defoliants -- including Agent Orange with its highly toxic
component dioxin -- were sprayed over central and southern Vietnam
during the war to eliminate cover for the Viet Cong and North
Vietnamese army.
