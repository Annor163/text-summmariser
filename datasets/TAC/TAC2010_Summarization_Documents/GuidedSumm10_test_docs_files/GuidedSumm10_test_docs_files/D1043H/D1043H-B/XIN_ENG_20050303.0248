The Swiss Foreign Ministry 
announced Thursday that it has agreed to a United Nations request 
to help investigate the Feb. 14 Beirut bombing which killed former
Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri.

The Swiss ambassador in Lebanon informed Peter FitzGerald, head
of the UN Fact Finding Mission in Lebanon, that Switzerland has 
agreed to send explosives experts to join the mission, the 
ministry said in a statement.

A similar request from the Lebanese authorities led the Swiss 
Foreign Ministry to the decision that experts would only be sent 
at the specific request of the UN.

The experts will leave for Beirut shortly to be integrated into
the UN mission.
