<P>
The family of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri announced Wednesday that his
second eldest son, Saad, would assume the political mantle left by the slain
leader.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came ahead of parliamentary elections that should take place by
the end of May. It did not say whether Saad Hariri would run for elections but
appeared to be a first step toward that aim.
</P>
<P>
"Saad Rafik Hariri will assume the historic responsibility and leadership of all
national and political affairs," a statement issued by the late premier's office
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Hariri's wife, Nazek, would assume responsibility for the
social and charity arm of Hariri's institutions.
</P>
<P>
It said the decision was taken after a family meeting Wednesday that came at the
end of the mourning period and was attended by Hariri's wife and their seven
children.
</P>
<P>
The decision put an end to weeks of speculation on whether any of Hariri's sons
would remain involved in politics following his assassination Feb. 14 in a
massive bombing. His family had committed to staying active but none of his
children had been named to assume his political mantle.

<P>
Hariri's sister Bahiya is a member of parliament.
