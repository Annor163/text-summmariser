<TEXT>
<P>
Lebanese legislators will choose a 
successor to Omar Karami, whose government resigned Monday amid 
mass protests two weeks after former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri 
was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
Under Lebanon's constitution, the prime minister is elected by 
parliament members with a majority in favor.
</P>
<P>
Customarily, the premier is a Sunni, the president a Maronite 
Christian and the parliament speaker a Shiite. The assassinated 
Hariri was a Sunni Muslim.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's sister Bahia Hariri should be considered seriously as a
candidate for the premiership, MP Boutros Harb told reporters 
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After the prime minister is elected, he or she will coordinate 
with the president and the speaker in choosing a cabinet, a move 
without deadline under the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Advice from former speakers and prime ministers will also be 
taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
The new government will assume office after winning a vote of 
confidence in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
President Emile Lahoud has asked the outgoing Karami government 
to continue as a caretaker until a new cabinet is formed.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Syria Karami government resigned Monday under huge anti-
Syrian pressure, one political fallout of Hariri's killing on Feb. 
14 by a massive bombing attack in central Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The oppositions blamed Syria for the incident, a charge denied 
by Damascus. However, Syria has indicated it would redeploy its 14,
000 troops in Lebanon.
