destabilizing the country since the assassination of former Prime 
Minister Rafik Hariri.

responsible for the explosions are aimed at destroying Lebanon and 
dragging its people into a whirlpool of violence.

Qordahi hoped that the Lebanese people will join hands and agree
on the formation of a new government as quickly as possible in 
order to hold the parliamentary elections on time.
