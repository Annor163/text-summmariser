announced resignation of his government on Monday amid massive 
demonstrations over the assassination of his predecessor Rafik al-
Hariri.

"Out of concern that the government does not become an obstacle 
to the good of the country, I announce the resignation of the 
government I had the honour to lead," Karami told parliament in 
Beirut.

Meanwhile, opposition groups, which accuse Syria of being behind
Hariri's death, called for popular protests to continue until Syria
withdraws its troops from Lebanon.

Earlier in the day, the parliament opened a debate on the 
assassination of Hariri in a bomb attack on Feb. 14, which also 
killed 17 others.

A no-confidence vote was expected at the end of the debate, but 
the special parliamentary session culminated with the resignation 
of Karami's government.

Syria, denying any involvement in the assassination of Hariri, 
has decided to redeploy its 14,000 troops in Lebanon under mounting
international pressure.
