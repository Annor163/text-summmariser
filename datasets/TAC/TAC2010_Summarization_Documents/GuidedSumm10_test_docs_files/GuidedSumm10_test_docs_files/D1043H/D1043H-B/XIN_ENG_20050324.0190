Head of the Lebanese Supreme 
Juridical Council Tanius al-Khori on Thursday appointed Alias Ayed 
as the new judge in charge of probing into the killing of former 
Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri on Feb. 14.

In a statement, Khori said his council had accepted the 
resignation of Judge Mitchell Abu Araj and made the new 
appointment.

Araj on Wednesday told reporters that he resigned because he had
too much work to deal with in the current phase.

A group of Lebanese members of parliament on Tuesday called on 
the Arab summit in Algiers to support the international 
investigation into the assassination of Hariri.

<P>
The lawmakers also appealed to the UN Security Council to bring 
those behind the assassination to justice as soon as possible.

A UN team dispatched to investigate the bombing completed its 
mission in Beirut on March 16 and is expected to announce 
initiative result on Thursday at the UN headquarters in New York.

<P>
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan told the Arab summit on 
Wednesday that he will release a report in the next few days on a 
fact-finding mission into Hariri's death, adding another in-depth 
probe may also be necessary.
