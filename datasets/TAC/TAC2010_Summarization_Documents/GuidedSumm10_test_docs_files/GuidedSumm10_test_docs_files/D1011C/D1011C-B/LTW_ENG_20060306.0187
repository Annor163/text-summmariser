Genetics Cited in Eating Disorders
</HEADLINE>

Two new studies show that genetics may outweigh any environmental
factors in producing the eating disorders involved in anorexia and
bingeing.

``This is good news for patients and their families,'' said Dr.
Cynthia Bulik of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.
In the latest issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry, Bulik and
colleagues studied records from 30,000 Swedish twins, some with
anorexia, and found that identical twins, who share identical genes,
were more likely to share an eating problem compared with fraternal
twins, who share half their genes, the same as non-twin siblings.

In this large sample, scientists figured out that genes were
responsible for 56 percent of the cases of the potentially
life-threatening condition. People with anorexia -- about 10 out of
every 1,000 women and 29 in every 1,000 men -- have symptoms that
include self-starving and an obsessional belief that they are fat.

<P>
Bulik and others are trying to identify genetic risk factors so
that they can better solve this puzzling eating behavior.

``We have gone through far too much time blaming parents,'' said
Bulik, who used a 30,000-person twin registry from Sweden to identify
the strong genetic contribution. ``People need to understand that they
are fighting their biology'' and not just a psychological need to be
thin.
</P>
<P>
Once genes are identified, the hope is that scientists can develop
drugs that work directly on these target genes.
</P>

In another study published in the same journal, a team of
investigators at McLean Hospital, a Harvard affiliate, found a strong
genetic contribution to binge-eating. Binge-eating is far more common
than other eating disorders, involving around 2 to 5 percent of the
population. As the name implies, these binges are characterized by
compulsive, episodic eating of large amounts of food in a short
period.

Dr. James Hudson, director of the biological psychiatry laboratory
at McLean and an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical
School, recruited 300 people, half with a history of binge eating, and
then set out to interview their parents, children and siblings. They
found that family members of binge-eaters were twice as likely to have
a similar eating disorder than those without such a history. And the
relatives of binge-eaters were more than twice as likely to be obese
than people who don't share this eating behavior.
</P>
<P>
Binge eaters are themselves no more likely than non-binge eaters to
be obese, Hudson said. They do share some other features, however:
They have more mood disorders and are more impulsive.
</P>
<P>
``There is very likely a genetic component,'' Hudson said. Both
Hudson and Bulik believe that preventions and treatments lie hidden in
the mysteries of the unidentified genes. Bulik and her colleagues have
identified two possible markers for genes associated with the brain's
opiate-like and serotonin chemicals. Both chemicals regulate mood,
behavior and pleasure.
</P>
<P>
In another study, Bulik found that people with anorexia say that
starving themselves makes them calmer. Normally, hunger triggers
anxiety.
