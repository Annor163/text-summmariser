When Anorexia Becomes a Family Value
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's the first advice that parents of daughters with anorexia are
often given: Don't make food an issue between you and your child.
Don't talk about food. Don't comment on what she eats or doesn't. And
certainly don't force food on her.
</P>
<P>
But force-feed is just what Laura Collins did with her 14-year-old
daughter Olympia -- after seven weeks of traditional therapy for
anorexia nervosa had failed to produce any results. And Olympia, now a
senior in high school, is thriving and well, says her mother.
</P>
<P>
Collins, a freelance writer who is the author of ``Eating With Your
Anorexic,'' was aghast several years ago when her daughter became ill
with anorexia, and she discovered that, as a mother, she was not
welcome in the therapeutic milieu.
</P>
<P>
``Not only were we not welcome in our daughter's therapy
sessions,'' Collins writes, ``we were advised to stay out of her
recovery. ... And under no circumstances were we to feed her.''
</P>
<P>
When Collins asked why, the counselor, ``Joy,'' responded, ``Aren't
you getting a little too ... involved?''
</P>
<P>
Like many other parents of anorexic daughters, Collins said she
definitely got the message from the therapeutic community that somehow
she and her husband were to blame for Olympia's illness. Olympia, who
had been an epicure, suddenly stopped eating when she injured her knee
in 2002 and no longer could continue to train for the Junior Olympics.
Collins, who lives in the Washington, D.C., area, has adopted a
pseudonym for herself and her daughter to protect the daughter's
identity.
</P>
<P>
``As the parent of an anorexic, your demotion as authority figure
is instantaneous,'' Collins writes. ``Anorexia nervosa is a damning
symptom of which you, the parent, are the cause. The only thing left
is to identify the mode of your sin.''
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Collins says, the available therapy wasn't working.
Olympia was seeing Joy once a week in 50-minute sessions during which
it seemed that they looked for deep-seated reasons for the disorder --
perhaps abuse or popular culture or family -- but didn't really talk
about eating. After seven weeks, Olympia was only losing weight.
</P>
<P>
Collins decided to take her to an eating-disorder clinic at a
hospital. A doctor spent 50 minutes with Olympia and then, without
consulting Collins, told the child she needed to be admitted that day
for a six-week stay.
</P>
<P>
Collins was shocked that anyone would expect her to turn over her
young daughter to ``strangers in a hospital on the strength of a
50-minute consultation with that child, without consulting any other
professionals, her medical records or even her parents.''
</P>
<P>
It was after such experiences that Collins decided she could keep
her daughter at home and give her the care she would have received in
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
``If the hospital would measure and serve her meals and watch her
eat, then so would we,'' Collins writes. ``If the hospital staff would
stay with her after meals to keep her from purging, so would we. If
the hospital would restrict her exercise, so would we. No arguing, no
negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
Most of the experts Collins talked to thought this was a bad idea
and wouldn't work. A nutritionist said her daughter might become
rebellious and run away.
</P>
<P>
But Collins did find support in the Maudsley approach, a
controversial technique developed in Britain in the 1980s that
encouraged parents to take an active role in the treatment of their
child. It applies to patients younger than 18 who live with their
parents.
</P>
<P>
``The Maudsley approach not only rejects the historic shunning of
parents during treatment but actually embraces their involvement,''
Collins writes, ``putting the responsibility to feed and nourish the
patient directly into the parents' hands.''
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Collins found an American doctor, Dr. James Lock of
Stanford University, who supported the technique and wrote the forward
to her book.
</P>
<P>
Collins took what she could find of the Maudsley approach and set
about ensuring that her daughter ate three squares a day -- no easy
task.
</P>
<P>
``You don't believe me, do you?'' Collins writes. ``I know what
you're thinking: 'You can't just make an anorexic eat.''
</P>
<P>
She and her husband did, however, adopting what Collins said was
the ``June and Ward Cleaver'' style of parenting: authoritative, no
nonsense, no negotiation. ``We left her no choice,'' said Collins.
``Yeah, she fought it. But you know, if it was chemo(therapy), I
wouldn't be negotiating amounts with her.''
</P>
<P>
While critics might call her approach ``force-feeding,'' Collins
sees it as ``supported nutrition.''
</P>
<P>
There was sobbing, raging and begging from Olympia, but Collins and
her husband adhered to the rules: Olympia had to eat her meals, or
nothing else would happen that day.
</P>
<P>
Collins left her part-time job, and sometimes one meal went so
long, it seemed to merge into the next. On weekdays, Olympia was
allowed to eat lunch at school but then was expected to report
honestly on what she had eaten. If she started to lose weight, Collins
told Olympia, she would have to eat lunch with her mother in the car
in the school parking lot.
</P>
<P>
That was never necessary because in the next four months, Olympia
made a slow, steady return to health.
</P>
<P>
It was difficult, but, Collins writes, ``There is a shift ... when
you stop seeing a behavior as a choice and start seeing it as a
medical, physical, somatically driven problem. The blame ends. The
guilt stops cold. You are back on the same side as your loved one --
even if she doesn't know it yet.''
