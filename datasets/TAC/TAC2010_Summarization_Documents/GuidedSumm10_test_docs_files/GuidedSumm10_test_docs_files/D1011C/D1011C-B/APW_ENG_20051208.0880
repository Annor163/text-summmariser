Compulsive eating support groups on the rise in the U.S.

<P>
Grabbing a handful of cookies off the plate, stealing a roommate's food,
overeating while home alone. These could be signs of compulsive
overeating.
</P>
<P>
The fixation in the United States on weight is only making the disorder more
prevalent, experts say. The number of support groups for people whose lives are
controlled by food has grown sharply in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have that switch that says, 'You've had enough.' I just always wanted
more and more and more," said Jim M., a member of Food Addicts In Recovery
Anonymous in Saginaw, Michigan. Like other 12-step programs, members of the
group do not allow the use of their full names.
</P>
<P>
Jim's obsession was so great he constantly broke off social engagements to eat
giant piles of food in the privacy of his home.
</P>
<P>
"I just always made food my priority," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998, the number of support groups hosted by Food Addicts has grown from
about 20 to 300 nationwide. Overeaters Anonymous, founded in 1960, now has more
than 4,300 meetings in the country.
</P>
<P>
David Levitsky, a professor of psychology and nutrition at Cornell University,
said compulsive overeating is becoming more widespread in part because the
country has a growing obsession with weight loss. Dieters make a religion of
calorie-counting, starving themselves until their bodies rebel with a
binge.
</P>
<P>
That sets off an ensnaring cycle of guilt, dieting and binge-eating, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"More people nationally are going on diets. And there's always going to be a
certain fallout of people who can't define when enough is enough," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Binge-eating disorder is more prevalent than anorexia or bulimia, according to
the National Association of Anorexia and Associated Disorders. A study by the
American Psychiatric Association in 2000 suggested between 0.7 percent and 4
percent of the population suffered from the disorder, but researchers believe
the actual figure is much higher, said Annie Hayashi, spokeswoman for
NAAAD.
</P>
<P>
Even thin people and those of average weight can be possessed by binge eating,
said Susan L., who chairs the group Food Addicts.
</P>
<P>
"Not all overeaters are obese, and not all obese people are overeaters," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The only uniting characteristic is an overwhelming preoccupation with food, she
said.
</P>
<P>
The behavior of compulsive overeaters is distinct from the average person who
might indulge in normal "emotional eating" _ like curling up with a carton of
ice cream after a breakup or taking comfort in macaroni-and-cheese on a blue
day.
</P>
<P>
Those in the throes of a binge feel they cannot stop and they eat until they are
physically uncomfortable, according to Overeaters Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
Still, health experts say diagnosis can be tricky in a nation where two-thirds
of the population is overweight and food is so linked with the
psyche.
</P>
<P>
Among the warning signs, noted by Mario Rago, a board member for the anorexia
and related disorders group:
</P>
<P>
_Cruising from store to store to hoard tubs of ice cream and bags of cookies to
consume in a single sitting.
</P>
<P>
_Racking up debt from buying food.
</P>
<P>
_Letting food take precedence over personal relationships and
work.
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, compulsive eating is isolating, and that was the tip-off to Anne B.,
a web designer in San Mateo, California.
</P>
<P>
Nobody seemed to suspect she had a problem. Her weight fluctuated, but she was
never obese. Slowly, she withdrew from friends and co-workers until she found
herself alone.
</P>
<P>
After joining Food Addicts nine years ago, the 31-year-old has finally came to
terms with her disorder. She weighs her food now to make sure she is eating an
appropriate amount.
</P>
<P>
For Jim M., coming to terms with compulsive eating has brought changes that go
beyond the 200 pounds he's lost. A former football player in college, he now
goes to the annual reunions and no longer avoids social situations to hide and
eat.
</P>
<P>
"If somebody asks me to do something, I don't make excuses anymore. I go," he
said. "Now I realize going to a restaurant is not about the food. It's about
being with your friends and having a good time."
