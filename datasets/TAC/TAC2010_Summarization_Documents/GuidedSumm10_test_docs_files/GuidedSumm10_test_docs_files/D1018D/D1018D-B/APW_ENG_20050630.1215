<P>
A month to the day after a U.S. teen disappeared on this Dutch Caribbean island,
prosecutors acknowledged Thursday they have no physical proof she was murdered
as a new contingent of Dutch marines prepared to launch yet another
search.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Caren Janssen said the absence of a body would not prevent
investigators from pursuing a murder case, yet neither she nor other prosecutors
have indicated whether they even believe 18-year-old Natalee Holloway is
dead.
</P>
<P>
"There are no traces or facts to come to the conclusion that Natalee is no
longer alive," Attorney General Caren Janssen told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview. "But that doesn't mean we can't prosecute without a body.
It's difficult but not impossible."
</P>
<P>
Janssen declined to reveal what other evidence investigators might have for a
potential murder case. Nor did she elaborate on whether prosecutors were even
treating their case as a murder, or as a missing-persons incident, as they had
indicated at one point during the case.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Holloway's May 30th disappearance, authorities arrested two former
hotel security guards whose defense attorneys said they were being held on
suspicion of murder and capital kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
On June 9, authorities detained Joran van der Sloot, the 17-year-old son of a
justice official in Aruba, and his two friends, Surinamese brothers Deepak
Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, "in the disappearance" of Holloway. Van der
Sloot's father was also later detained "as a suspect" in the disappearance,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
A judge has since ruled there was not sufficient evidence to continue holding
the father, Paul van der Sloot, a 52-year-old judge in training, and also
ordered the release of the former hotel security guards. Earlier this week, a
judge also said there was not sufficient cause to continue holding a party boat
disc jockey in the case.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, the three young men, who remained in custody Thursday, may be
held another 95 days without being formally charged.
</P>
<P>
Confusing the issue further, Janssen told the AP on Thursday that Paul van der
Sloot gave his son and two arrested friends legal advice, telling them just days
after Holloway's disappearance that "without a body there is no
case."
</P>
<P>
"He confirmed to me that he told them that a few days after she disappeared,"
Janssen said. She did not comment on why the father may have said such a thing,
however, or whether investigators interpreted his comments to mean that there
was a body somewhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
Holloway's stepfather, George "Jug" Twitty, said the family wasn't surprised by
the attorney general's comments, but was not losing hope that the truth would be
found.
</P>
<P>
"We may have no physical evidence, but there is a lot of other evidence of what
may have happened in this case," Twitty told the AP. "There are lies, tales and
changing stories" from the Kalpoes and Joran van der Sloot, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Janssen also said that Paul van der Sloot obstructed authorities' investigation
by asking one of Joran's friends, who had been interrogated, what he told
police.
</P>
<P>
"The father and the mother have asked a friend of Joran to come to their home to
tell them what he has explained to the police," Janssen said. "And that was an
obstruction of the investigation."
</P>
<P>
But Janssen said the elder van der Sloot had been arrested for being a suspect
in the disappearance, not for obstructing the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Calls to the van der Sloot's residence Thursday seeking comment were not
answered.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Thursday, Aruban government spokesman Ruben Trapenberg said the
Netherlands government had approved a request from Prime Minister Nelson Oduber
to allow additional Dutch Marines to participate in a search for
Holloway.
</P>
<P>
Several previous, massive searches by authorities, Dutch Marines, and thousands
of islanders have produced no trace of Holloway, a recent high school graduate
from Mountain Brook, Alabama.
</P>
<P>
The latest search group, the Texas-based Texas EquuSearch, also has failed to
find Holloway after using specially trained dogs and ocean-searching sonar
equipment. Oduber issued a request for additional Dutch marines at EquuSearch's
behest.
</P>
<P>
A total of 70 Dutch Marines are on the island, but it wasn't clear how many all
together would participate in the latest search.
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, The Rev. Tony Peralta led about 250 people, including her mother,
Beth Holloway Twitty, in prayer in front of the Holiday Inn, where Holloway was
staying before she disappeared.
</P>
<P>
"Lord, give us the joy of finding Natalee," Peralta said.
