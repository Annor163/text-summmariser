<P>
Police took a jailed Dutch teenager Saturday to retrace his steps at the beach
where he says he last saw Natalee Holloway the morning she disappeared in
Aruba.
</P>
<P>
Police took Joran van der Sloot, 17, to a beach near the Marriott Hotel where he
has admitted to being alone with the 18-year-old Alabama woman in the early
hours of May 30, said police superintendent Jan van der Straaten.
</P>
<P>
Van der Straaten declined to provide further details, saying only that it was
"part of the investigation." Police have taken van der Sloot to the site
before.
</P>
<P>
Van der Sloot's mother, Anita, has said her son told her he was alone with
Holloway on the beach but he did not harm her.
</P>
<P>
The beach is near the Holliday Inn where Holloway had been staying during a
graduation trip with 124 classmates. She vanished hours before she was to catch
her flight home.
</P>
<P>
Van der Sloot, the son of a judge in training in Aruba, faces no charges, and
authorities can hold him until Sept. 4, when he must be charged or released. Six
other men who have been detained at various times during the investigation have
been released.
</P>
<P>
Extensive searches by Dutch marines, Aruban police, FBI agents and some 2,000
volunteers have found no trace of Holloway.
</P>
<P>
Three divers and seven land searchers from the Dickinson-based volunteer Texas
EquuSearch group were set to leave Aruba on Sunday. They have been on the island
since June 23.
