A 17-year-old Dutch youth must remain behind bars as authorities try to find out
what happened to Natalee Holloway, who was last seen six weeks ago leaving a
nightclub, an appeals court said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The court also ruled that there was not enough evidence to detain two Surinamese
brothers in connection with the disappearance of the 18-year-old Alabama
woman.
</P>
<P>
During a closed hearing Tuesday, a judge heard appeals from a defense lawyer
seeking the release of Joran van der Sloot _ the son of a judge in training on
the island _ and from prosecutors asking for the re-arrest of Deepak Kalpoe, 21,
and his brother, Satish, 18.
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel decided there was adequate grounds to suspect van der Sloot
of involvement in Holloway's disappearance. "He was in her company and gave
varying statements about what happened then and afterwards," according to the
ruling, which was read by a court clerk.
</P>
<P>
The ruling also said that van der Sloot had recently change his account of the
night of Holloway's disappearance and authorities need time to investigate the
new version.
</P>
<P>
"We are a bit disappointed," said Richie Kock, a lawyer for van der Sloot. "We
had a fair chance that he would be released."
</P>
<P>
Van der Sloot and the Kalpoes were among the last people to see Holloway, of
Mountain Brook, Alabama, before she vanished on the final night of her
high-school graduation trip to the Dutch Caribbean island. Another court ordered
the release of the brothers July 4, citing insufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
Van der Sloot has been in custody since June 9, when he was arrested along with
the brothers. No one has been charged in Holloway's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
Van der Sloot's father, Paul, and three other men were detained in the case but
later released.
</P>
<P>
Holloway vanished in the early hours of May 30, just before she was to catch a
flight home from a five-day vacation celebrating graduation with 124
classmates.
</P>
<P>
Extensive searches of the island and surrounding waters by Aruban and Dutch
authorities, FBI agents and volunteers have turned up no trace of the young
woman.
