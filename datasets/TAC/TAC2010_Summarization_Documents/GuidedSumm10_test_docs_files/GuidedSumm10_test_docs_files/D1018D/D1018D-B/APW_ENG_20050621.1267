<P>
The questions haunt the Alabama teenagers who accompanied Natalee Holloway on
her ill-fated graduation trip to Aruba.
</P>
<P>
What happened to bright, blond Natalee that night she left Carlos'N Charlies', a
popular island bar, with a Dutch teen? Where is she? And, perhaps the most
fearsome: Is there something they could have done differently?
</P>
<P>
Outwardly upbeat yet plainly troubled since their senior trip turned into
international news, friends and former classmates from Mountain Brook High
School gathered Tuesday for a cookout to raise money for Holloway's relatives,
who have been searching for her in Aruba for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
In between starting the charcoal grill and passing out food, they talked about
the frustrations of not knowing what happened to the 18-year-old honor student
known as "Hooty" or "Nat."
</P>
<P>
Beau Barron, 18, said he and other classmates who went on the trip didn't know
what to think when Holloway failed to show up for the flight home to Alabama on
May 30. "Initially it was just disbelief," said Barron.
</P>
<P>
As the days turned into weeks following her disappearance, most everyone who was
on the trip wondered whether they could have done more to make sure Holloway got
back to their hotel safely, he said.
</P>
<P>
"(But) that's something you don't need to dwell on because you can't turn back
time," said Barron.
</P>
<P>
Madison Whatley, one of Holloway's three roommates during the trip, has been a
regular at prayer vigils at a local church. She also wears a baby blue rubber
bracelet that says "Hope for Natalee."
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating, but it helps to come to the prayer service," Whatley
said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the teens' questions center around Joran van der Sloot, the 17-year-old
son of a Dutch justice official in Aruba. He is being held along with three
others in Holloway's disappearance and reportedly told authorities he left the
bar that night with Holloway.
</P>
<P>
Holloway's friends saw van der Sloot both in the casino at the hotel where they
were staying and at Carlos'N Charlies', and a friend of Holloway said van der
Sloot _ a tall, broad-shouldered athlete _ got into a scuffle with some of the
Alabama visitors at the bar.
</P>
<P>
"I broke it up," said Bryan Reynolds, 18. "It was outside the Carlos'N Charlies'
the second night we were there."
</P>
<P>
Reynolds didn't elaborate, and Barron said people who went on the trip aren't
publicly discussing details of what happened in Aruba at the request of
Holloway's family, which fears the publicity could hamper the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The media glare itself has been a shock in itself for the kids from Mountain
Brook, a wealthy, cloistered Birmingham suburb.
</P>
<P>
"I was talking with a friend last night about how I was so amazed that it's
gotten so big and is all over the nation," said Sarah Burton,
18.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the unanswered questions, Holloway's family is taking strength from
her friends.
</P>
<P>
"These kids are hopeful. We all are hopeful," said aunt Marcia
Twitty.
