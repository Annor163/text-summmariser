	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- The district attorney's office wants funds  
to extend the JonBenet Ramsey grand jury session into August. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury probe into the child beauty queen's December 1996  
killing began last September and is now funded through the end of 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are working on a request,'' said Assistant District  
Attorney Bill Wise on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, agencies investigating the Ramsey case have spent an  
estimated $1.74 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury has not met since May 25. During that period,  
Boulder detectives have been conducting additional investigation 
into JonBenet's killing, collecting DNA samples from some witnesses 
and interviewing others on specific details about Patsy Ramsey, 
JonBenet's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Patsy and John Ramsey are considered suspects in the murder of  
their child, who was found beaten and strangled in the basement of 
their Boulder home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys, who moved to Atlanta with their son, Burke, in July  
1997, have maintained their innocence.
