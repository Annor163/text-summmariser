<HEADLINE> Detective in Ramsey Case Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Linda Arndt, who was the only detective in  
John and Patsy Ramsey's home when their daughter's body was found, 
has resigned from the Boulder Police Department after 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt handed in her resignation letter Thursday. Police services  
director Mark Beckner declined to comment and officials wouldn't 
release the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt was the first detective to arrive at the Ramsey home on  
Dec. 26, 1996, after Mrs. Ramsey called 911 to report finding a 
2 1/2-page ransom note. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records said Arndt asked Ramsey to search the house for  
anything unusual. He went downstairs and emerged minutes later with 
the body of 6-year-old JonBenet, who had been beaten and strangled. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests have been made in the case, though the Ramseys remain  
suspects. A grand jury has been hearing evidence since 
mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder police have been heavily criticized for failing to  
promptly separate and interrogate the Ramseys and for allowing 
Ramsey to recover the body of the little beauty pageant queen. 
</P>
<P>
	The unrelenting criticism and the department's response to it  
are at the heart of a federal lawsuit Arndt has filed against the 
city and former Police Chief Tom Koby, who resigned in November 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt claims her right to free speech was impeded by a  
department-wide gag order blocking officers from discussing the 
case. She is suing Koby for what she considered his failure to 
correct others' ``false, damaging and defamatory'' statements about 
her work. 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt testified before the grand jury last fall but has remained  
publicly silent about her involvement in the case.
