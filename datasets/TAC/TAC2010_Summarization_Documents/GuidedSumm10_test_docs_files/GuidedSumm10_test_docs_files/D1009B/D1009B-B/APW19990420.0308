<HEADLINE> Experts Theorize About Ramsey Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- The evidence amassed in the slaying of  
JonBenet Ramsey seems to point in two distinct directions: toward a 
family member and toward an intruder. 
</P>
<P>
	As a grand jury wraps up its investigation, prosecutors have  
identified only two people as being under suspicion: JonBenet's 
parents, John and Patsy Ramsey. 
</P>
<P>
	But evidence pointing to an outsider has turned up, such as  
unidentified DNA material in the little girl's underwear, and a 
palm print and a shoe print found near the body that police have 
yet to identify. 
</P>
<P>
	The two theories, each with its supporting evidence, could  
create enough reasonable doubt in the minds of jurors to make a 
successful prosecution unlikely, legal analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is enough evidence that one of three people did it to  
make it impossible for the criteria of reasonable doubt to be 
satisfied,'' said Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, referring 
to JonBenet's parents and a possible intruder. ``It's what the 
Constitution set out. Whenever there is reasonable doubt, you have 
to acquit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dershowitz, who uses the Ramsey slaying investigation during  
class discussions on reasonable doubt, predicted that the grand 
jury will return an indictment in the slaying of the 6-year-old 
beauty queen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes no talent to indict,'' he said. ``Conviction is very,  
very different. It's a case where it sounds like it will be 
impossible to satisfy the legal standard of proof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Andrew Cohen of Denver, a frequent analyst for the news  
media, called the case ``a defense attorney's dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a defense attorney, you're going to be much more  
comfortable in this case, despite the fact that it is a horrific 
murder, than in one where there is a confession,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was early on the day after Christmas in 1996 when Mrs. Ramsey  
called police and told them she had found a ransom note demanding 
$118,000 for her daughter. Eight hours later, Ramsey said he found 
his daughter's body in the basement of their home. She had been 
beaten and strangled. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys, who since have moved to suburban Atlanta,  
repeatedly have denied involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have been criticized for allowing family friends to  
wander about the home and for asking Ramsey to conduct the search 
that led to the body. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, police and prosecutors were at odds for months  
following the slaying. The lead police investigator resigned, 
accusing District Attorney Alex Hunter of mishandling the case and 
trying to protect the Ramseys. Then, homicide investigator Lou Smit 
resigned, insisting that there was credible evidence of an intruder 
and that the Ramseys were innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury has been examining the slaying since  
mid-September, and those close to the case believe that its work 
will be complete by mid- to late May. The grand jurors could issue 
an indictment, choose not to indict anyone or write a report 
outlining their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the proceedings are secret under Colorado law, legal  
analysts believe prosecutors have presented evidence of both 
theories to jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without question, the grand jury looked at the possibility of  
an intruder because that's at the heart of any analysis of the 
JonBenet Ramsey case,'' said Denver attorney Craig Silverman. 
</P>
<P>
	Here is a look at some of the key findings in the slaying, based  
on information from published reports, and author Lawrence 
Schiller's book ``Perfect Murder, Perfect Town'': 
</P>
<P>
	-- Police have yet to identify a palm print found on the wine  
cellar door leading to the room where the body was found and have 
not found who made a shoe print found in dust near the body. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Unidentified DNA material was found in JonBenet's underwear  
and unidentified skin was found under her fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Lab tests have confirmed a pen and legal pad found inside the  
Ramsey home were used to write the ransom note. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The voice of JonBenet's older brother, Burke, reportedly can  
be heard on an enhanced tape of Mrs. Ramsey's 911 call. The Ramseys 
initially told police Burke was asleep when they called. Silverman 
called this ``one of the greatest contradictions in the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- There was no forced entry to the home, but an apparent pry  
mark was found on a kitchen door jamb. In addition, several keys to 
the home were missing. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A piece of broken glass was found on top of a suitcase under a  
broken basement window. An intact spider web was found on a grate 
that covered the window well, but entomologists believe a spider 
could have created the web on a warm winter day. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Police have never recovered the roll of duct tape or cord used  
in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case has been a defense attorney's dream since the  
Boulder police made the mistake of thinking it was just a 
kidnapping and not a murder,'' Cohen said. ``The only question is 
whether police work since then, or DA work since then, can overcome 
those monumental mistakes early on.''
