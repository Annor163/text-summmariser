<HEADLINE> Book: Mrs. Ramsey Tough With Cops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- JonBenet Ramsey's mother switched from  
charming to tough when challenged by a detective, leading police to 
believe she was ``capable of bringing harm to her daughter,'' 
author Lawrence Schiller writes in a new book on the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perfect Murder -- Perfect Town,'' which will be released later  
this week, examines several facets of the crime, including 
differences between police and prosecutors, tabloid speculation and 
the culture of Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Schiller said an investigator found Patsy Ramsey to be charming  
and polite for the first two days of questioning in June. 
</P>
<P>
	But when police Detective Tom Haney pressed her on the third day  
-- suggesting he had evidence against her and telling her she had 
lied to him -- Mrs. Ramsey replied, ``Pal, you don't want to go 
there. Don't start that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tougher the questions became, the tougher Patsy  
became...,'' Schiller said. ``Still, it was almost impossible to 
believe that she'd gone from being a normal mother, which until 
then she had given every indication of being, to being a murderer 
that night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schiller has written about other infamous crimes. He co-wrote  
``American Tragedy: The Uncensored Story of the Simpson Defense'' 
and helped O.J. Simpson write ``I Want to Tell You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Hal Haddon, who represents JonBenet's parents, John and  
Patsy Ramsey, declined comment on the book. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been arrested in the death of JonBenet, 6, who was  
found beaten and strangled in her family's Boulder home Dec. 26, 
1996.
