<HEADLINE> Investigator Arrests Spur Concern </HEADLINE>

	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The company was known as ``Dirty Deeds Done  
Cheap'' and ``Phantom Investigations,'' and clients included 
private investigators, the media and companies checking out the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	If authorities are correct, James and Regena Rapp and their  
employees lied and schemed to get detailed personal information -- 
bank and telephone records and credit-card bills -- on the JonBenet 
Ramsey murder investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple's recent indictment on racketeering charges has  
spurred concern over the apparent ease in which that information 
was obtained. The Rapps' company billed itself as an ``information 
broker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a question of identity and privacy,'' said Tara Lemmey,  
president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit 
organization that tracks the Internet and privacy issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, it's a case of fraud. We already have good fraud  
laws on the books. The larger question is, should people have the 
right to get information on another person,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rapps did not return a phone message seeking comment Monday.  
Court records listed no attorney for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Their arrests followed a sting operation by the Colorado Bureau  
of Investigation to recover information in the Ramsey case. 
JonBenet, 6, was found strangled and beaten in her Boulder home on 
Dec. 26, 1996. No arrests have been made, though her parents have 
been described as being under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the Rapps and their employees at TTI telephoned  
companies to ask for copies of personal records, claiming to be 
that person. The copies were faxed to a phone number that routed 
the documents to TTI, according to a Jefferson County grand jury 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the documents seized last month were the cellular phone  
records of John and Patsy Ramsey, credit card bills, banking 
records for Ramsey's former company, Access Graphics, and records 
of his plane trips. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment also says the Rapps obtained information about  
the Ramsey investigation itself. Included in the court case file is 
a letter purportedly from John Ramsey to McGuckin Hardware, asking 
for information about credit card purchases by his wife for $46.31 
and $99.88 just weeks before their daughter's body was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Police reportedly believe the cord and duct tape used to kill  
JonBenet likely had been purchased by Mrs. Ramsey at the store. The 
Ramseys, who have moved to an Atlanta suburb, have maintained their 
innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the indictment, TTI worked out of a strip mall  
office in Aurora and had more than 1,200 subscribers. On a typical 
day, the company got more than 100 calls or faxes requesting 
confidential information. 
</P>
<P>
	In the sting, an agent set herself up as a target to see what  
TTI could find out about her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we'd run it up the flagpole. She was surprised by  
the details they found,'' Brown said. ``It came back exactly what 
her phone bill was and bank balance statement was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators paid $460 for the information.  
</P>
<P>
	Pam Russell, a spokeswoman for Jefferson County prosecutors,  
said investigators are trying to determine whether whether 
supermarket tabloids and other publications bought information 
about the Ramsey case from the Rapps. If they knew the information 
was stolen, they could face charges. 
</P>
<P>
	She said no major publications have been identified so far. CBI  
agent Robert Brown said authorities were not targeting the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain things in our lives that are personal and  
private -- our finances, who we call, who we talk to,'' he said. ``I 
can't even get this information without a warrant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemmey said that with the proliferation of computers and  
databases, personal information given in confidence isn't always 
kept private. 
</P>
<P>
	``People assumed the information they provide will only be used  
for a driver's license or to buy a dishwasher,'' she said. ```They 
need to know that the information is now being used for other 
things.''
