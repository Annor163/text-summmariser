	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- JonBenet Ramsey's 12-year-old brother was  
reportedly questioned by the grand jury investigating the little 
girl's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke Ramsey appeared before the panel last week, according to  
today's Denver Rocky Mountain News, which cited a family friend, 
and KUSA-TV. Boulder authorities would not comment on whether the 
boy appeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just don't ever comment on grand jury matters, whether  
they're true or false,'' said Suzanne Laurion, spokeswoman for 
District Attorney Alex Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	However, authorities have said previously that Burke is  
considered a witness in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke was 9 when his sister was found beaten and strangled in  
the basement of the family's Boulder home in 1996, the day after 
Christmas. Other than his parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, Burke was 
the only person known to have been in the house when the 6-year-old 
was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said that the parents remain under suspicion. A  
grand jury has been investigating the case since Sept. 15. Its work 
is secret, but it's believed neither of JonBenet's parents has 
appeared before the panel.
