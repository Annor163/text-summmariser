<HEADLINE> How Teddy Bear Became a Clue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- The teddy bear sought by authorities in  
the JonBenet Ramsey case first emerged as a clue in an interview 
last summer with her mother, Patsy Ramsey, The Denver Rocky 
Mountain News reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The toy was reportedly among stuffed animals found in JonBenet's  
room. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper quoted two investigators as saying that Mrs.  
Ramsey claimed the toy did not belong in her slain daughter's room 
when she was shown crime scene pictures by police in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``She stiffened,'' said one investigator, speaking on condition  
of anonymity. ``The way it was described she went white. ... She 
was saying, `Where did it come from? I've never seen that 
before.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Boulder District Attorney Alex Hunter posted a  
photograph of a stuffed toy bear dressed in a Santa Claus suit on 
the Internet and asked for the public's help in finding information 
about the bear. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter refused to comment on how the toy might be connected to  
the investigation of the 1996 slaying of 6-year-old JonBenet. 
Investigators say they now know the manufacturer, distribution and 
sale points of the bear, but won't say why they need this 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	The little girl's parents remain under suspicion as a grand jury  
investigates the crime. The Ramseys have proclaimed their 
innocence.
