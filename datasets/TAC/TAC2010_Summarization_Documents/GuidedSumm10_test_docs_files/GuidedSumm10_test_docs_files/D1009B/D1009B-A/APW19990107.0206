<HEADLINE> Ramsey Probe Receives More Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Prosecutors received nearly $80,000  
Thursday to help finance the grand jury investigation into the 
JonBenet Ramsey slaying through March. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it goes beyond that date, we will be back looking for more  
money,'' Assistant District Attorney Bill Wise said. ``It is not 
meant to predict when the grand jury is going to end'' 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996, in the  
basement of her family's elegant home in Boulder. Authorities said 
JonBenet had a fractured skull and may have been sexually 
assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests have been made. Police say her parents, John and  
Patsy Ramsey, remain under suspicion. The Ramseys have maintained 
their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury, whose work is kept secret, began meeting in  
mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder County, which funds the district attorney's office,  
approved the new money despite a bill for the case that already had 
reached nearly $390,000. It is the most ever spent by the office on 
an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The city already has spent more than $1 million in its  
investigation.
