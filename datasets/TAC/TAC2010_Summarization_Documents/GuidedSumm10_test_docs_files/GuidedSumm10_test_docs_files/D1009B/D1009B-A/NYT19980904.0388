 &HT;    Two special prosecutors appointed to Ramsey case

<P>
   The district attorney in Colorado overseeing the JonBenet Ramsey
homicide case on Friday appointed two new special prosecutors to
present evidence to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Boulder District Attorney Alex Hunter appointed Bruce Levin and
Mitch Morrissey, in part, because of criticism he has mishandled
the Ramsey case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given all the recent questions ... public confidence demanded
absolutely that we have the most experienced prosecutor we could
get,'' said Suzanne Laurion, spokeswoman for Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Levin and Morrissey together have 32 years of experience
prosecuting homicide cases. They work in Colorado counties outside
of Hunter's jurisdiction, but will answer to Hunter on the Ramsey
case. The grand jury will begin hearing evidence later this month,
Laurion said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Colorado Gov. Roy Romer refused to appoint a
prosecutor who could have taken the case over from Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Romer made his decision after a police detective who
investigated the slaying of the 6-year-old girl resigned and
claimed Hunter bungled the Ramsey case.
</P>
<P>
   Romer also considered a Ramsey family friend's claim that
Hunter's friendship with lawyers representing John and Patsy Ramsey
clouded his judgment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The friend, Fleet White, criticized the Ramseys, saying their
refusal to cooperate with detectives hurt the investigation of
their daughter's death. The Ramseys remain under suspicion in the
homicide.
</P>
<P>
   White was with John Ramsey when he found JonBenet's battered and
strangled body in a basement room of the Ramseys' Colorado home
Dec. 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys now live in Atlanta.
