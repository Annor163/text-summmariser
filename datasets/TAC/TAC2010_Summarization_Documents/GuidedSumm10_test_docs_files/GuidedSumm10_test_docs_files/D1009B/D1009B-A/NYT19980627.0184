 &HT;    Family's reason for cooperation spurs speculation
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider

   ATLANTA -- When John and Patsy Ramsey hired lawyers after their
daughter, JonBenet, was killed and then distanced themselves from
police, it didn't sit right with Nancy Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they did not work with police from the beginning
led me and my family to place a cloud of suspicion over the
family,'' said Gordon, an Acworth schoolteacher and mother of
three.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Ramseys had three days of interviews last week with
investigators from the district attorney's office, Gordon wondered,
``Why the wait? What has changed? If they have nothing to hide,
they have nothing to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Gordy of Atlanta said the Ramseys' stated reason for
waiting makes sense. The Ramseys say they broke off talks with the
police 14 months ago because they felt the police were out to get
them, said their attorney Hal Haddon. They waited for the case to
be handed over this month to the district attorney, whom they
trusted more, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'd be talking either,'' said Gordy. ``Everybody
kind of jumped on them in the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramsey interviews arrive as Boulder, Colo., District
Attorney Alex Hunter decides whether to take the case to a grand
jury. After conducting full-day sessions of videotaped interviews
Tuesday through Thursday, Hunter said he is leaning toward
convening a grand jury. Recent developments, he said, might delay
his decision beyond his original early July estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey have been cooperative,'' said Hunter, who
declined to discuss the specifics of the conversations held in
Colorado, except to say the family handed over some important
documents. Their 11-year-old son, Burke, also was interviewed over
three days in Atlanta, where the family now resides.
</P>
<P>
   Burke was in the family's Boulder home when 6-year-old JonBenet
was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996. While his parents are
among those under ``an umbrella of suspicion,'' police say the boy
is not a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the interviews allowed the family and
authorities to feel out each other. Denver legal analyst Andrew
Cohen said he also sees some posturing for the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ramseys can say, `The cops were incompetent, so much so
that we didn't want to talk to them. As soon as the case went to
the district attorney, we did go in,''' said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Haddon, the Ramsey attorney, said the family's communication
with the district attorney actually began over a year ago and
included handing over records regarding medical, phone, bank and
business matters. John and Patsy Ramsey were interviewed
simultaneously in separate rooms last week, each accompanied by an
attorney and a private investigator, and no restrictions were
placed on the questioning. The only condition demanded by the
Ramseys was that ``police not be in the room,'' said Suzanne
Laurion, a district attorney spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews can have benefits for both the investigators and
the Ramseys, said Christopher Mueller, a law professor at the
University of Colorado. The investigators can probe the family
members' knowledge and look for any important inconsistencies in
their stories. A family member can, if innocent, offer more tidbits
to help the probe and, if guilty, persuasively lie to prevent a
prosecution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be posturing; they may be trying to help,'' Mueller
said.
