Divers help clear debris from tsunami-hit coral reefs in southern Thailand

PATONG BEACH, Thailand
</DATELINE>

<P>
Dozens of scuba divers are removing furniture and other debris swept into the
ocean by the Dec. 26 tsunami, hoping to rescue fragile coral reefs and marine
life that have long made Thailand's southern coast a top tourist
destination.
</P>
<P>
Strapping on air tanks and masks, divers from the Environment Ministry and as
far away as Sweden and Britain plunged into the waters off Patong beach Saturday
at the start of an effort to clear popular underwater sites and revive the
island's sagging tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
After combing the Patong coastline for four days, they plan to move south to
another beach, Kata, for a similar cleanup organized by the Department of Marine
and Coastal Resources, said Wannakiat Thubthinsang, director of the Phuket
Marine Biological Center.
</P>
<P>
"We will clear every beach in Phuket," he said. The divers, mostly volunteers,
have been asked to collect "everything _ furniture or chairs or construction
cement blocks. ... The small ones they can pull up themselves, but the bigger
ones they will mark by buoy and then ask the boats to come in," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Development Program says debris such as suitcases, kitchen sinks and
deck chairs threatens coral reefs _ the delicate formations that are a habitat
for marine life and an attraction for divers _ and that it will provide
equipment for the cleanup campaign.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have yet to conduct a complete survey of damage to coral reefs from
the tsunami that roared across the Indian Ocean, but experts fear some of
Earth's most spectacular coral formations may carry scars for
years.
</P>
<P>
Heavy debris such as trees and cars may have slammed into reefs like battering
rams, while silt and sand may have buried and choked the tiny organisms that
build them. Some minor damage is repaired by the coral fairly quickly, but major
reef destruction can take decades to heal, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Roland Ubasch, a 37-year-old diver from Valkenburg, Netherlands, said the group
would first look through coral beds, then scan the area's sandy
seabed.
</P>
<P>
"First we'll try to clear the coral because the waste can make it damaged," he
said.
</P>
<P>
A former Swedish military diver, Johan Wachenfeldt, 57, said he would help clean
the reefs after the tsunami, which killed several Swedish friends who helped him
buy property in Phuket just two months ago. Many of the nearly 5,300 people who
died in Thailand were northern Europeans.
</P>
<P>
Wearing wetsuits, the divers jumped from boats parked off Patong beach,
surfacing minutes later with mesh bags stuffed with bottles, sandals, bathroom
tiles and shards of concrete. Others hauled out crumpled pieces of corrugated
steel and called for help to raise chairs.
</P>
<P>
"I had a few sandals in my bag," said one diver, Paul Donne, 37, of London. "You
don't really want to think about where they came from. There was nothing really
gruesome down there, just personal effects."
</P>
<P>
Areas off the western side of Patong beach, where diver training courses
operate, were badly damaged, but nearby Kata and Karon beaches emerged mostly
unharmed, said Niphon Phongsuwan, a Phuket Marine Biological Center
researcher.
</P>
<P>
But other areas were devastated.
</P>
<P>
In waters off the Surin islands, near Thailand's marine border with Myanmar, the
tsunami wrecked some coral fans and branches that once hosted schools of
colorful fish, said Thorn Thamrongnawasawat, a marine ecologist from Kasetsart
University. "Nothing is left but sand," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the Similan islands, one of Thailand's best-known diving destinations, two
sites _ Christmas Point and Hin Kalok _ were ruined, Thorn said.
</P>
<P>
Other sites around the islands were only slightly damaged, and Richelieu Rocks,
a world-famous spot for viewing whale sharks, remains intact.
</P>
<P>
In the Phi Phi island area, Pai island and the western side of Phi Phi Don
island's Ton Sai beach saw coral reefs overturned, broken or strewn with
garbage. The beach of nearby Phi Phi Lei island, which was the set for the
Hollywood film "The Beach" starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was safe.
</P>
<P>
All of Thailand's marine national parks, including the Surin islands, have been
closed since the tsunami struck and dozens of marine ecologists have been
assessing reef damage.
</P>
<P>
Kasetsart University's Thorn said diving locations severely damaged will be put
off limits to tourists or preserved for studies on the environmental impact of
the tsunami. But already it's clear that ecosystems and biodiversity have been
hurt, he said, calling for tougher restrictions to protect the
areas.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has become one of the world's most popular destinations for divers
because of its pristine waters, thriving marine life and low-cost
facilities.
