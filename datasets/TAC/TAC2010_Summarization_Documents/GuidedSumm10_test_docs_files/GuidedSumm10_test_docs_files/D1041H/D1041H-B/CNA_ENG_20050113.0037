A recent United Nations report on the
status of the world's coral reefs sent a warning signal to the Taiwan
authorities with the news that nearly 75 percent of them have been
damaged or are seriously threatened.
</P>
<P>
The global report, titled Status of Coral Reefs of the World:
2004, attributed bleaching of coral reefs off Taiwan's coasts to a
combination of factors, including overfishing, waste-water
pollution, damage by recreational divers and nuclear power plant
operations.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued by UNESCO, analyzes the coral reef status in
96 countries around the world, including Taiwan. According to the
report, coral reefs exist in the waters surrounding Taiwan, except
for the west coast.
</P>
<P>
Of the 32 Taiwan coral reef areas subject to the UNESCO study, 18
of them have lost up to 70 percent of their live coral colonies due
to bleaching, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, aquaculture ponds, highway construction,
recreational parks and farming in Taiwan's coastal regions, coupled
with soil degradation and mudslides, have all hurt Taiwan's coral
reef health.
</P>
<P>
In response to the UNESCO report, local scholars and
environmentalists urged the government Thursday to address the
problems and adopt effective measures to safeguard coral reefs. They
also urged the government to revise its economy-oriented
environmental development policy and strategies.
