Thailand's largest coral 
clean-up operation intensified Saturday, with hundreds of divers 
rushing to clear tonnes of debris polluting world-class dive sites 
in the Andaman Sea before April monsoons.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's marine and coastal resources department director 
general Maitree Duangsawasdi estimated that only around 10 percent 
of some 78 square kilometres (30 square miles) of coral reefs in the 
Andaman Sea were damaged by the December 26 earthquake and giant 
waves.
</P>
<P>
But potentially deadly debris ranging from general garbage to 
kitchen sinks littering the ocean floor are harming the coral and 
could impede reef regeneration, he told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The tsunami-battered Phi Phi islands southeast of Phuket island 
are probably the dirtiest, with an estimated 1,000 tonnes of debris 
in the ocean and some 7,000 tonnes on land, he said.
</P>
<P>
Phuket's west coast got off a little lighter, with several 
hundred tonnes of garbage likely to have obscured the blue waters 
surrounding popular tourist beaches in Patong, Karon and Kata.
</P>
<P>
"Coral reef is not only important to marine resources but to 
Thailand's tourism industry," Maitree said after flagging off some 
300 divers, mainly volunteers from local dive shops and foreign 
tourists, at Patong beach.
</P>
<P>
"We must try to clear the debris before April because the 
monsoon season will bring more dirt, and this could cause damage to 
the corals to stretch into the long-term."
</P>
<P>
Despite scores of dive shops in Thailand being obliterated by 
the tsunamis, several of Phuket's 80-odd dive operators contributed 
personnel to the vast effort.
</P>
<P>
The clean-up kicked off earlier this month at Phi Phi and moved 
this weekend to Phuket beaches. Next month divers turn their sites 
on Krabi and Phang Nga provinces, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the 300 divers at Patong, another 70 people in three 
boats gathered at another jetty to head to the Ratcha Yai dive 
site.
</P>
<P>
Maitree said one day's activity could cost about 10,000 dollars, 
but support from the diving community had been outstanding, with 
people coming from Bangkok just over the weekend to help out.
</P>
<P>
Off the shores of Patong, a Buddhist monk on board the MV 
Discovery vessel owned by Santana Diving recited a prayer and 
blessed each diver before they jumped into the sea.
</P>
<P>
"We pray to the dragon god of the sea to protect the divers and 
to bless the souls of the thousands of tsunami victims who died in 
suffering," said monk Bhikkhu Buddha Dhatu.
</P>
<P>
In a pavilion on the beach, a dozen Buddhist devotees sitting 
around a long table chanted an hour-long special rite for the dead 
before burning paper money and making food offerings to the 
deceased.
</P>
<P>
Divers from several boats hauled in a catch of mainly corrugated 
iron and broken cement pieces from premises torn apart by the 
tsunamis, as well as broken bottles, garbage and fishing nets.
</P>
<P>
They said the water was generally clean, and several were 
excited after spotting a tiny seahorse and an array of colorful 
fishes.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's clean-up is supported by the United Nations 
Development Program (UNDP), which has provided equipment for the 
operation. The UNDP has warned that some sites suffered extreme 
sedimentation damage and that heavy sand will eventually kill the 
coral if it is not removed.
