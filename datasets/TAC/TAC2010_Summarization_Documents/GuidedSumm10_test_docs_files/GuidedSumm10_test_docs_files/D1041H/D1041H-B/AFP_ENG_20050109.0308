Conservationists fear worst over tsunami damage, urge lessons to 
be learned

UNAWATUNA, Sri Lanka, Jan 9
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From huge chunks of coral 
flung up hillsides, to broken-up shacks, cars and other wreckage 
lying in watery offshore graves, the scale of the tsunami's 
environmental damage is evident along huge swathes of Asian 
coastline.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the extent of devastation caused by the giant waves 
has laid bare some stark realities: the plight of poor fishing-folk 
forced to live on the fringe to earn a living, man's folly at 
clearing natural coastal habitats to chase the tourism dollar, and a 
modern ignorance of the power of the sea.
</P>
<P>
All assistant dive instructor Ranjit Sirinaga, 38, in this 
popular Sri Lankan resort knows is that his livelihood and beloved 
reefs could be gone forever.
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of coral out there, and many colourful fish," 
he said,  staring out to the wind-whipped sea and wondering aloud 
just how much remained.
</P>
<P>
"We still have to look and see what happened," Sirinaga said 
nervously, taking a break from reconstruction work on the 
tsunami-ruined dive shop where he works. "I hope it hasn't been 
destroyed."
</P>
<P>
Visibility has been too bad since the giant waves struck to take 
the shop's only seaworthy boat out to check on the reef with a dive, 
but a few snorkelling trips nearer to shore have offered a gloomy 
glimpse of the consequences.
</P>
<P>
Three tuk-tuks, two motorbikes, and huge chunks of boats litter 
just one section of the bay, and coral closer to shore is smothered 
in sand.
</P>
<P>
Sirinaga is keen to get back in the water for a full assessment 
but is baffled by the unforgiving elements.
</P>
<P>
"Normally in season, at this time, it's a flat, calm sea. But 
since this happened, the sea is rough. It's different."
</P>
<P>
Palm-fringed Unawatuna beach is a popular dive location luring 
50 to 60 divers a day in peak season. Before the tsunami struck on 
December 26, it was one of hundreds of resorts around the Indian 
Ocean coastline that was busy year-round with snorkellers, scuba 
divers and tourists in search of paradise.
</P>
<P>
Across thousands of miles of tropical Asian coastline coastline 
there are similar scenes of destruction. Tourist hotels demolished 
by the towering waves, entire fishing villages swept away.
</P>
<P>
"What has made this a disaster is that people have started to 
occupy part of the landscape that they shouldn't have occupied," 
said Jeff McNeely, chief scientist of the Swiss-based World 
Conservation Union (IUCN), who lived for several years in Indonesia 
and Thailand, two of the countries worst hit by Sunday's disaster.
</P>
<P>
"Fifty years ago the coastline was not densely occupied as now 
by tourist hotels."
</P>
<P>
The beach-dwelling poor and itinerant fishing communities bore 
the brunt of the disaster. Many had cleared mangroves and started 
shrimp farms to feed the huge Western market for cheap prawns.
</P>
<P>
"The mangroves were all along the coasts where there are shallow 
waters. They offered protection against things like tsunamis," said 
McNeely. "They were cleared by people who didn't have the long-term 
knowledge of why these mangroves should have been saved, by 
outsiders who get concessions from the governments and set up shrimp 
or prawn farms."
</P>
<P>
Parts of India and Myanmar, where coral reefs and mangroves 
remained intact, fared much better when the waves hit than the 
denuded coastlines of Thailand and parts of Sri Lanka, experts 
noted.
</P>
<P>
"Places that had healthy coral reefs and intact mangroves were 
far less badly hit than places where the reefs had been damaged and 
the mangroves ripped out and replaced by beachfront hotels and prawn 
farms," said Simon Cripps, director of the Global Marine Programme 
at environment group WWF International.
</P>
<P>
"Coral reefs act as a natural breakwater and mangroves are a 
natural shock absorber, and this applies to floods and cyclones as 
well as tsunamis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Conservationists hope lessons will be learned from the 
catastrophe which left more than 155,000 people dead and wiped out 
homes and livelihoods of millions more.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has earmarked 
one million dollars to address immediate environmental needs in the 
regions struck by giant waves across the Indian Ocean coasts.
</P>
<P>
But UNEP Executive Director Klaus Toepfer stressed "revitalising 
local communities and their livelihoods will require rehabilitating 
and protecting vital natural ecosystems, in particular mangrove 
forests and coral reefs".
