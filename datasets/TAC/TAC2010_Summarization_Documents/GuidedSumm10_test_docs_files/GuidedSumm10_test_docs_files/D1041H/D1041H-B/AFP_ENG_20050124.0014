A team of researchers is meeting this 
week in New Caledonia to mark the launch a French initiative aimed 
at protecting the coral reefs of island states in the South 
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The three-year project aims to support already-designated 
protected marine sites and to create new protected areas while 
better managing marine ecosystems to ensure the sustainable 
development of coral biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
Overfishing, poor management of coastal areas and sedimentation 
due to creeping urbanisation are often cited as the main threats to 
reef ecosystems, although those in the Pacific are less at threat 
than those in other regions.
</P>
<P>
"The reefs of the South Pacific and more especially of the 
Central Pacific are well protected because demographic pressure is a 
lot less than in Southeast Asia, where most reefs are found," said 
Bernard Salvat from France's Practical School of Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
The expert on reef systems said that low levels of pollution in 
the region further benefited the Pacific reefs.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that reef systems across the world are in decline 
due to pressure from tourism, other human factors and possibly 
global warming.
</P>
<P>
The nine-million-euro (12-million-dollar) programme is being 
financed by the French Development Agency.
