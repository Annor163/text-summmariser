The Thai government has launched a
project for volunteer divers to help revive coral reefs damaged in
the tsunami last month, reported the Thai News Agency on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A site survey conducted by government and private agencies to 
evaluate damage to the coral reefs by the disaster found coral 
reefs around the Similan Islands had been destroyed, according to 
Sita Divari, deputy secretary-general to the prime minister.

<P>
The survey around the Similan Islands and nearby areas found 
three spots that had been seriously devastated and should be 
closed till the coral reefs were able to revive, he was quoted as 
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the initial assessment, coral reefs lying to the 
east of the islands were seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
However some 90 percent of them are still alive and could be 
restored.
</P>
<P>
The tsunami waves displaced a large number of table corals.
</P>
<P>
If they are left stranded, they are likely to die within a 
month, said Sita Divari.

<P>
The Thai government has launched a four-month campaign to help 
the coral reefs to recover.
