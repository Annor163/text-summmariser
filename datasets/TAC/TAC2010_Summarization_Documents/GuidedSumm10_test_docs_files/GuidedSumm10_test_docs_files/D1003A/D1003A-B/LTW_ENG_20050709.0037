Panda Gives Birth at National Zoo//(Washn) 
By Richard Simon=(c) 2005, Los Angeles Times=

<P>
WASHINGTON -- The capital's newest celebrity isn't a Democrat or
Republican. It's a giant panda cub no bigger than a stick of butter.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed baby was born at the National Zoo early Saturday to Mei
Xiang, one of two giant pandas that have become a popular Washington
attraction, drawing about 1.5 million visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
Zoo officials said the newborn was doing fine and was secluded with
its mother in the zoo's giant panda quarters, monitored around the
clock by veterinary staff via cameras.
</P>
<P>
The birth was seen as a hopeful sign for efforts to revive the
endangered species. ``It is definitely a great day at the National
Zoo,'' said spokesman John Gibbons. ``Because giant pandas are
endangered, each birth helps strengthen the species' future.''
</P>
<P>
Zoo officials called the next few days critical.
</P>
<P>
Five cubs were born between 1983 and 1989 to a different pair of
pandas -- now deceased -- brought to the National Zoo after President
Nixon's groundbreaking trip to Beijing in 1972. None of the cubs lived
more than a few days. They are highly susceptible to infection.
</P>
<P>
This is the first cub born to 6-year-old Mei Xiang (pronounced
may-SHONG), who was artificially inseminated in March, and 7-year-old
male Tian Tian (t-YEN t-YEN). The pair were loaned to the zoo by China
in 2000 for 10 years. In return, the zoo contributes $1 million a year
to panda conservation efforts in China.
</P>
<P>
There are thought to be only about 1,600 giant pandas left in the
wild, Gibbons said. Pandas can be found at only three other U.S. zoos
-- in San Diego, Atlanta and Memphis, Tenn. Pandas were born at the
San Diego Zoo in 1999 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
The latest baby belongs to China and would be returned there,
probably after two years, if it survives.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Zoo officials said the cub was active, making a loud squealing
noise, and that Mei Xiang was showing signs of being a ``great
mother.''
</P>
<P>
``She picked up the cub within about two minutes of its birth and
has been cuddling and cradling it since then,'' the zoo said in a
statement posted on its Web site. ``When mom dozes off, and the cub
squeals, she immediately wakes up and attends to it.''
</P>
<P>
Zoo officials said they planned to intervene only if the cub shows
signs of distress or the mother begins to ignore it. They said they
probably would be unable to determine its gender until they can
conduct a medical exam, which might not occur for a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Mother and baby could not be viewed Saturday on the zoo's so-called
``panda cam'' because -- in a sign of the commercial value of
black-and-white animals -- the Animal Planet TV network had purchased
exclusive rights to tape their first 24 hours together for later
broadcast.
