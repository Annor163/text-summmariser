<P>
Taipei City Government will form a task force
soon to facilitate its bid to host the two giant pandas that China
has offered as gifts to the Taiwan people, Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that the city government's "panda task force, " to be
headed by his deputy Yeh Chin-chuan, will strive to have the pair of
pandas housed at the Taipei City Zoo.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Taipei City Zoo has been preparing for nearly 10
years to accommodate pandas, Ma said construction of the zoo's panda
quarters are expected to be completed in the near future. He added
that zoo keepers have been receiving special training on panda
nurturing and that funds required for this project are also in place.
</P>
<P>
On the decision of Shoushan Zoo in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung to compete for the right to house the Chinese pandas, Ma
said that Kaohsiung is welcome to enter the competition, although he
added that he believes Taipei City is more capable of taking care of
the pandas.
</P>
<P>
Ma urged relevant government agencies to accelerate their
screening and assessment procedures on the import of the two pandas
so that the animals can be welcomed into Taipei City Zoo smoothly
when their new home is built, scheduled for early next year.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the panda is an animal protected by the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and that there
are only about 1,000 left in the world, Ma said that having pandas at
Taipei City Zoo would not be simply for entertaining visitors, but
also to show the zoo's capabilities in conserving, nurturing and
studying special wild animals.
</P>
<P>
The two pandas, very likely to be provided by the Wolong Panda
Conservation District of China's western province of Sichuan, are
expected to attract more than 1 million extra visitors to Taipei City
Zoo each year if indeed they are allowed to be brought to Taipei, Ma
said.
</P>
<P>
Council of Agriculture Chairman Lee Chin-lung said Tuesday that
his council will act according to the law and professionally assess
without regard for political considerations whether Taiwan can
adequately care for the pandas.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks after Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan
Affairs Office of China's State Council, announced in Shanghai the
same day several goodwill gestures toward Taiwan, including a gift of
a pair of pandas for the people of Taiwan, to cap a historic visit to
China by Lien Chan, chairman of Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that the panda is a CITES protected animal and that
according to the organization's regulations, the export and import of
pandas requires permits from the organization.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's wildlife conservation law also stipulates that only
academic research and educational institutes can apply to import
protected animals, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He added that pandas are internationally recognized and that if
Taiwan fails to take proper care of the endangered animals, the
country will face international condemnation.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the COA will make a comprehensive study to
determine whether the pandas can be adequately cared for, Lee said,
adding that political considerations will not be included in the
review process.
