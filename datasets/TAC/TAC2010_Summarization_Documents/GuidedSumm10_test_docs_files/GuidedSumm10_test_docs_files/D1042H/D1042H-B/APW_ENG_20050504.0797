<P>
The reputed ringleader in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal on Wednesday called into
question whether Pfc. Lynndie England knew she was committing wrongful acts when
she took part in the mistreatment of Iraqi detainees.
</P>
<P>
The testimony of Pvt. Charles Graner Jr., contending that notorious photos taken
of England at the prison were to have a legitimate use, could endanger England's
guilty plea to seven abuse charges. Under military law, a judge can formally
accept her guilty plea only if she knew at the time that what she was doing was
illegal.
</P>
<P>
Col. James Pohl, the judge, will question England again Wednesday afternoon to
try to clarify her state when the abusive acts occurred.
</P>
<P>
Graner was found guilty in January and is serving a 10-year prison term for his
role in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Pohl abruptly stopped England's sentencing hearing after Graner testified that
three pictures he took of England holding a naked prisoner on a leash were meant
to be used as a legitimate training aid for other guards.
</P>
<P>
That contradicted England's contention Monday, when she pleaded guilty. She told
the judge that day that she knew at the time that the pictures were taken purely
for the amusement of the guards at the Baghdad prison.
