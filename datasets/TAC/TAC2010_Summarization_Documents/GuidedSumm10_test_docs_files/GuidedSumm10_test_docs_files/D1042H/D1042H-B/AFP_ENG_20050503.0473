Private Lynndie England, the US 
leash, faced a military jury Tuesday as the sentencing phase of her 
court-martial began.
</P>
<P>
England, 22, on Monday admitted seven charges of abusing Iraqi 
detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison. She said she posed alongside 
naked prisoners because of peer pressure.
</P>
<P>
When asked why she held her thumbs up and pointed at the 
genitals of a naked prisoner being held at the jail near Baghdad, 
England said her friends talked her into it.
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't want to do it," she said. "They were being very 
persistent, bugging me about it, so I was like, okay, whatever."
</P>
<P>
The abuse pictures were shown around the world and led to 
widespread condemnation of US practices in Iraq at a time when US 
forces were trying to bring the country under control after the 2003 
invasion.
</P>
<P>
Much of the morning was spent on selecting the nine officers and 
enlisted soldiers for a jury. They were questioned on their opinions 
of the media, psychologists, and whether they had ever worked with 
or met the people involved.
</P>
<P>
One brigade commander on the list said of the Abu Ghraib 
scandal: "I was disappointed for the army overall. It was a shame. 
It was a blight on the army."
</P>
<P>
Another when asked about the photos, said: "I can't hardly 
believe something like those types of photos could happen."
</P>
<P>
England now faces a maximum penalty of 11 years in jail. Her 
lawyers are expected to try to show she has mental problems to try 
to reduce her sentence. They must tread carefully, however, because 
any evidence showing that England was not guilty of the crimes could 
lead the judge to throw out her plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
The proposed punishment under England's plea bargain -- which 
the New York Times reported to be 30 months -- will remain secret 
until after the panel decides the sentence it believes she should 
face. England will then receive the lesser of the two sentences.
</P>
<P>
England faces six counts of maltreatment and one count of 
committing an indecent act. The sentencing hearing is expected to 
last until at least Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As well as the infamous image holding a leash, England is also 
seen pointing to the word "rapeist" (sic) written on the exposed 
buttocks of a prisoner, posing with naked prisoners who formed a 
human pyramid and with one who had been forced to masturbate. 
</P>
<P>
She was also photographed performing fellatio on Graner, the 
father of her newborn baby, who is serving a 10-year jail term for 
beating and sexually humiliating prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Graner, who is reported to have married another soldier charged 
in the scandal, Megan Ambuhl, is expected to testify Tuesday. 
England said she believes Graner took photos of the abused prisoners 
"for his own amusement."
</P>
<P>
Of the eight soldiers charged over the Abu Ghraib scandal, only 
Graner's case has gone to trial.
</P>
<P>
Five soldiers pleaded guilty and received sentences ranging from 
a dishonorable discharge to eight years in prison. The final 
hearing, that of Specialist Sabrina Harman, is scheduled to begin 
May 11.
</P>
<P>
A number of US investigations categorized the abuse as isolated 
acts. But many critics have raised suspicions that the US 
administration has protected the upper ranks.
</P>
<P>
Some top officers have received nonjudicial punishment, 
including Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, commander of the 
military police unit at Abu Ghraib, was relieved of her command and 
reprimanded.
</P>
<P>
The senior US military commander in Iraq at the time, Lieutenant 
General Ricardo Sanchez, and three other high-ranking officers were 
cleared last week of any wrongdoing by a US military probe.
