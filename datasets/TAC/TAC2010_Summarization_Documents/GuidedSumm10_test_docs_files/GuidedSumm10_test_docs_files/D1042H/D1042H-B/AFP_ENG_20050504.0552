The judge presiding over the 
court-martial of Lynndie England, the soldier photographed with an 
Iraqi detainee on a leash, Wednesday threw out her guilty plea for 
one of her charges in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal.

<P>
Judge Colonel James Pohl said there was no way to resolve 
contradictions in testimony regarding England's plea to conspiring 
to mistreat prisoners after her former boyfriend, Charles Graner, 
the alleged ringleader in the abuse scandal, testified that he had 
ordered her to hold the leash.
