A military judge Wednesday threw out Pfc. Lynndie England's guilty plea to Iraqi
prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib, saying that he was not convinced that she knew
that her actions were wrong at the time.
</P>
<P>
Col. James Pohl entered a plea of not guilty for England to a charge of
conspiring with Pvt. Charles Graner Jr. to maltreat detainees at the
Baghdad-area prison.
</P>
<P>
The action came after Graner testified at England's sentencing hearing that
pictures he took of England holding a naked prisoner on a leash at Abu Ghraib
were meant to be used as a legitimate training aid for other
guards.
</P>
<P>
When England pleaded guilty Monday, she told the judge she knew that the
pictures were being taken purely for the amusement of the guards.
</P>
<P>
Pohl said the two statements could not be reconciled.
</P>
<P>
"You can't have a one-person conspiracy," the judge said before he declared a
mistrial and dismissed the jury.
