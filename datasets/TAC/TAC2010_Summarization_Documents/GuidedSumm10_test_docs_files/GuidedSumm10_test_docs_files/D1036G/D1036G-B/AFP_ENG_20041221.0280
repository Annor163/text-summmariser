<P>
Ukraine's parliament decided Tuesday to investigate the recent
sacking of the deputy chief of the country's SBU security service
amid persisting questions on the poisoning of opposition leader
Viktor Yushchenko who has accused authorities of trying to kill him.
</P>
<P>
The parliament voted to set up a committee to look into President
Leonid Kuchma's decision to fire Volodymyr Satsyuk, a high-level
dismissal that was not made public but which Satsyuk himself
confirmed in an interview published Tuesday with the weekly
Stolichnye Novosti.

<P>
Satsyuk also holds a seat in parliament within the pro-Kuchma Social
Democratic Party and "if the president decided to prevent him from
accumulating too many posts, that's one thing," Stepan Havrich,
another pro-Kuchma deputy, was quoted by Interfax newal of trying to
murder him during the presidential campaign, but has declined to name
any government agency or particular individuals of carrying out the
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Some physicians in Ukraine and other countries have also disputed the
conclusions announced by Yushchenko's doctors in Vienna, saying that
while toxic and potentially fatal, dioxin was unlikely to have caused
the effects that Yushchenko has suffered from.
