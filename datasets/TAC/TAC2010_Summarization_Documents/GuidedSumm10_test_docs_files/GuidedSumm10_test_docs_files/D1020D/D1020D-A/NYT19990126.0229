<P>
   When the first reports of a food-poisoning outbreak from hot
dogs and deli meats started to accumulate in state health
departments across the United States last August, officials could
not have guessed that the effort to contain the eruption would be
so ineffective that they would still be counting victims five
months later.
</P>
<P>
   A recall of meats made by a Sara Lee Corp. subsidiary, Bil Mar
Foods in Zeeland, Mich., began on Dec. 22. But some state public
health officials say the outbreak could have been contained sooner
had the Agriculture Department done its job.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, the Agriculture Department has announced recalls
of processed meats contaminated with listeria from four other
companies in the last four months, most recently last weekend. But
consumers may have a difficult time understanding why those recalls
were announced by the government and Bil Mar's was not.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria monocytogenes is not a serious threat to healthy
people, causing only short-term gastrointestinal problems. But it
is a big risk to people 75 and older, people with compromised
immune systems, pregnant women and the very young. Pregnant women
and their unborn children are in the greatest danger. The current
outbreak associated with Bil Mar has been blamed for 13 deaths and
two miscarriages or stillbirths; in all, there have been 70
confirmed cases.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike salmonella and E. coli 0157:H7, which have become
household words in the United States, listeria is not well known.
There are only 1,000 to 2,000 reported cases of listeriosis in the
United States each year; an accurate figure cannot be obtained, as
health professionals do not routinely test for it and many cases go
undetected.
</P>
<P>
   But health officials find it especially troubling because, based
on the number of reported cases, the percentage of people who die
from it is much higher than from most other food-borne bacteria.
And the incubation period is much longer, up to 70 days before
symptoms appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listeria is rare,'' said Dr. Robert Tauxe, chief of the
food-borne and diarrheal diseases branch of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, ``but in someone susceptible, it
is catastrophic.'' In addition to causing miscarriages and
stillbirths, listeria can cause fatal blood infections and
meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   Without a new method of detection, Tauxe said, ``I don't think
we would have identified where the listeria came from.''
</P>
<P>
   The new system, called Pulsenet, gives scientists the ability to
fingerprint the DNA of bacteria and then compare the fingerprints
to see if the listeria is from a common source. The system was set
up in 1997 to track E. coli 0157:H7, but it appears to be equally
successful with listeria.
</P>
<P>
   American scientists began to take listeria seriously in 1985,
when 18 deaths were traced to the eating of Jalisco brand soft
cheese. (The company is now defunct.) There were also 30
stillbirths and deaths of newborns. Another 142 people became ill.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria is carried in the intestines of animals and can easily
come in contact with dairy products, uncooked meats, fish, poultry
and vegetables as well as precooked meats like the ones responsible
for the August outbreak. The investigators say they do not know how
the listeria contaminated the cooked meats at Bil Mar Foods.
</P>
<P>
   Food-borne diseases like listeriosis are more troubling today
for several reasons, including changes in the makeup of the
population and the increasingly complex way food is processed and
distributed. The population is aging: In 1950, 2.6 percent of
Americans were over 74; by 1995, the percentage was 5.6. The number
of people who survive cancer for five years has also increased, as
has the number of people who have AIDS or are living with
transplanted organs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the centralization of food production has turned
what might previously have been a small local problem into a global
one. Products from the Bil Mar plant, for example, are distributed
all over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dr. Michael Osterholm, the state epidemiologist at the
Minnesota Health Department, says he is increasingly frustrated
with the federal government's response to outbreaks of food
poisoning, and even with the new detection system.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bil Mar Foods case, the Agriculture Department left the
announcement of the recall to the company. The agency does not
announce recalls until it has proof that a sealed product contains
the disease-causing bacteria, and it did not have that proof until
Dec. 31, nine days later.
</P>
<P>
   When the company announced the recall, a spokesman for the
Agriculture Department, Andrew Solomon, said, reporters who cover
the agency were notified and the information was put on the
agency's Web site and on its consumer-information line
(800-535-4555).
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the word was out there and an additional press release
would not have generated new news coverage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Osterholm disagrees. ``If there had been a real effort to get
the message out by the Department of Agriculture throughout the
country, consumers would have had more awareness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Dale Morris, the director of the division of
infectious disease of the New York State Health Department, say
there can never be enough notification. In Broome County, in
upstate New York, they say, Meals on Wheels was still serving the
Bil Mar products to elderly clients eight days after the recall,
because it had not been notified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people are one of the highest-risk populations in the
country,'' Osterholm said. And there may still be tainted hot dogs
or deli meats in people's freezers.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, the Agriculture Department did take action. Over
the weekend, it announced the recall of hot dogs from Thorn Apple
Valley in Forrest City, Ark., because of listeria.
</P>
<P>
   The previous week, the agency announced the recall of deli meat
from Oscar Mayer Foods for the same bacteria, as it did in October
for hot dogs made by Dixie Packers Inc. of Madison, Fla., and
cheeseburger sandwiches from Hormel Food Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the last line of defense against food-borne illness is
consumers, who are advised to take the standard measures: thorough
cooking of raw animal products, thorough washing of all food that
is to be eaten raw like fruits and vegetables; keeping foods to be
eaten raw separate from uncooked meats; thorough washing of hands,
knives and cutting boards.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other disease-causing bacteria, listeria can grow in
a refrigerator that has a normal temperature of 40 degrees, which
means leftovers should be reheated.
</P>
<P>
   But how does this advice fit in with meats that people expect to
eat without further cooking?
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials strongly urge those at greatest risk
from listeria to stay away from all soft cheeses, including feta
and blue-veined cheeses like Roquefort and Camembert. They also say
that it is essential to cook hot dogs until the internal
temperature reaches 165 degrees, by either steaming or frying.
Cooking in the microwave is not recommended. And unless people at
risk are willing to eat salami, corned beef and pastrami hot _ in
other words, cooked again _ they should not eat them at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listeria hasn't been on anyone's radar screen,'' Tauxe said.
``But it's something pregnant women should be made aware of. At
this point, as far as I can tell, the number of pregnant women who
are aware of this is zero.''
