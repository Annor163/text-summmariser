	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Two batches of Heinz baby food have been
recalled in Hong Kong following a similar action in the United
States over worries they may contain high levels of lead, the
Health Department said Monday.
	   A statement said 14,000 jars of 4-ounce (110 gram) Vegetable
Chicken Dinner and 2.5-ounce (70 gram) Beginner Strained Carrots
were being recalled by the distributor in the territory.
	   It said the department has also taken some samples of Heinz
products for further testing.
	   Last week, Heinz officials in the United States said the traces
of lead pose little health risks.
	   The problem was discovered in a routine Food and Drug
Administration review of supermarket shelves. No illnesses have
been reported.
