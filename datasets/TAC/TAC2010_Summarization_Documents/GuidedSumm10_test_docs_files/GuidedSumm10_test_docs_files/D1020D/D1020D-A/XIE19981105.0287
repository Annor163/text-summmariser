<HEADLINE> U.S. Company Recalls Beef in Bacteria Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. company said
Wednesday that it was recalling all ground beef it produced on
October 22 because it may contain the potentially deadly E.coli
O157:H7 bacteria.
</P>
<P>
IBP, the world's largest processor of fresh beef, said in a
report the recall involved 556,226 pounds of ground beef produced
at its plant in Dakota City, Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
Retailers, food service operations and distributors in a total
of 33 states have been identified as having received the ground
beef, said the company, adding that much of it is believed to have
been consumed already.
</P>
<P>
But no illnesses have been reported in connection to the beef
produced on that day and the company said it had notified the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, which was testing the product.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, IBP recalled a shipment of 282,129 pounds of
beef after a sample was found to be tainted by the same bacteria.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said E.coli O157:H7 accounts for more than 20,000
infections and 200 deaths annually in the United States.
