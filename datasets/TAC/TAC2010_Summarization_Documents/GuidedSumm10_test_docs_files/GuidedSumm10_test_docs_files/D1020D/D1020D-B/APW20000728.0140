<HEADLINE> Beef recall affects lunch programs at Nebraska schools  </HEADLINE>

   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Enough beef to make nearly 20,000
quarter-pound hamburgers won't be distributed to Nebraska schools
due to a recall ordered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 79,200 pounds of beef will sit in a southwest Omaha
warehouse until the USDA decides what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA in June ordered a recall of 2 million pounds of beef
sent to 16 states for distribution to schools from Dallas-based
meatpacker Supreme Beef Processors Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The recall announcement came amid a quarrel over sanitary
conditions at Supreme Beef.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Carpenter, an administrator with the Agriculture
Department in Washington, D.C., said Friday that the meat was
recalled because of the company's failure to meet USDA quality
standards, not any specific problem with the meat in question.
</P>
<P>
   The meat was shipped in late April to Nebraska for use in
schools participating in the federal school lunch program. None of
the meat ever left the warehouse, said Brad Petersen, an accountant
with the Nebraska Health and Human Services System.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska was notified of the recall in June and school officials
were told that same month to find other sources of beef for the
coming school year.
</P>
<P>
   John Bonaiuto, director of the Nebraska Association of School
Boards, said no school had contacted him with fears about having an
adequate beef supply for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't heard a thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schools may either cut back on the amount of beef offered for
lunches early in the year or find another source, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beef supplied from the USDA for the school lunch program
accounts for about 20 percent of all beef used by the state's
schools, said Connie Stefkovich, administrator of nutrition
services for the state Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA will replace the recalled beef but probably not until
October, Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department has tried to temporarily close
Supreme Beef after the plant failed a series of federally required
tests for salmonella bacteria, which can cause digestive ailments.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled in May that the testing was not a fair
measure of a plant's sanitation and the judge barred the department
from withdrawing its inspectors, an action that would force the
plant to close.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA said last month that it was planning new safety
standards for the ground beef it buys for schools. The rules will
be similar to testing requirements that McDonald's and other fast
food restaurants impose on meatpackers.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 states where the meat was shipped are: Connecticut,
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Idaho, Massachusetts,
Mississippi, New York, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, and West Virginia.
