<HEADLINE> E. Coli Blamed in Minn. Beef Recall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Authorities are investigating an outbreak of  
illness from E. coli-contaminated ground beef after at least six 
guests became ill at a Maine ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking into whether or not other states may be involved  
as well,'' said Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the federal Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak has been linked to meat recalled from Rochester  
Meats Inc. in Rochester, Minn., the Agriculture Department said 
Monday. Beth Gaston, spokeswoman for the food safety and inspection 
office, said scientists found ``genetic fingerprints'' linking a 
strain of E. coli ``in samples of the meat from Rochester Meats to 
the patients in Maine who have become ill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On USDA orders, Rochester Meats Inc., of Rochester, Minn., which  
supplies meat for restaurants and institutions, recalled 170,780 
pounds of product last week. That's the equivalent of one day's 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said Monday they were unaware of any link  
between their product and illnesses. ``USDA has not confirmed that 
with us,'' said Rochester Meats spokeswoman Joanne Randen. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled products include frozen ground-beef patties, ground  
chuck patties, chopped beefsteak, beef patties, meat for chili, 
beef patty mix and pure beef bulk. 
</P>
<P>
	The meat was produced Dec. 1 and sold in 10-, 15- and 20-pound  
packages. They are marked with the Julian code 8335 and 
Establishment 8999 in the inspection mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine officials had a tally of seven E. coli illnesses, but USDA  
has not confirmed the seventh was a genetic match to the Rochester 
Meats outbreak, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The people became ill while visiting the Sunday River Ski Resort  
in Bethel, Maine, said Dr. Kathleen Gensheimer, state 
epidemiologist for the Maine Department of Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The first illness was reported Feb. 11, and three people were  
hospitalized, Gensheimer said. Everybody in the group, which 
included four children, has recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	It is possible that other people became ill but treated  
themselves instead of seeking medical attention, Gensheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 cases in the United  
States every year of infections attributed to E. coli 0157:H7, the 
strain in the Maine case, according to the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingested by humans, E. coli bacteria can cause serious illness  
and sometimes death, especially in children and the elderly. 
Symptoms include chills and bloody diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident is the second outbreak in the country related to  
contaminated meat in recent months. Bil Mar Foods in Zeeland, 
Mich., recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and deli meats in 
December because of possible contamination with listeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen deaths and six miscarriages and stillbirths have been  
linked to the Bil Mar recall.
