<HEADLINE> Meatpacker Recalls Ground Beef  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Canadian packing plant of IBP Inc.
voluntarily recalled 46,000 pounds of ground beef products Saturday
because of possible contamination with E. coli 0157:H7, the second
recall in two days for the United States' largest beef processor.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service
said IBP-Lakeside Packers in Brooks, Alberta, produced the products
May 31 and shipped them to Kansas, Kentucky and Tennessee, as well
as to locations in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   All products sold in the United States were packed in 10-pound
vacuum-packed tubes, with eight tubes per case. Shipping cases were
marked L0231BH, L0311BH, L0791BH. Tubes under recall are marked
003800152A (or B), with one of the following codes: 81 GRD BEEF; 86
GRD BEEF; 73 GRD BEEF.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection service said the possible contamination was
discovered in laboratory tests by a customer in Canada and reported
to Canadian authorities, who relayed the warning to the USDA.
</P>
<P>
   No ailments have been reported from any of the recalled meat.
</P>
<P>
   In a release, the Lakeside plant said most of the beef was to
have been processed by grocers or restaurants before being sold to
consumers, which means no brand names or product codes are
available for home checks.
</P>
<P>
   IBP acquired the Lakeside Farm Industries in 1994, IBP's first
wholly owned subsidiary outside the United States. IBP is based in
Dakota Dunes, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, IBP recalled 266,000 pounds of ground meat produced
May 13 at a plant in Geneseo, Ill., also for possible E. coli
0157:H7 contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria can cause bloody diarrhea and dehydration.
Children, the elderly and people with suppressed immune systems are
the most susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   The government recommends cooking all ground beef to at least
160 degrees to destroy bacteria.
