	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A meat packer has voluntarily recalled
more than a ton of beef bologna that may be contaminated with
listeria, the USDA announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Consumption of food that contains listeria can cause
listeriosis, an uncommon but potentially fatal disease, according
to the United States Department of Agriculture. Healthy people
rarely contract the disease that can cause high fever, severe
headache, neck stiffness and nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Listeriosis also can cause miscarriages and stillbirths and
serious or fatal infections in people with weak immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Zweigle's Inc. of Rochester is recalling 2,200 pounds of its
beef bologna sold in 10-15 pound logs. Each carton bears the
sell-by date of 07-01-00 and a production date code of 0137. The
carton also bears EST.5333 inside the USDA seal of inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The meat was produced May 16 and distributed to grocery
delicatessens in Rochester and the Finger Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
   No illnesses have been reported in connection with this product,
the USDA said.
