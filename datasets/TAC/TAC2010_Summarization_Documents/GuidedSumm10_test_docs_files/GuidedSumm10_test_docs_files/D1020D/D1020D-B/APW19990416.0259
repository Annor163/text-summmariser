<HEADLINE> Problems at Bil Mar Before Recall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Federal inspectors uncovered unclean practices  
and faulty procedures at a meat processor in the months leading to 
a massive recall over a deadly listeria outbreak, the Detroit Free 
Press reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The concerns about Bil Mar Foods Inc., including inaccurate  
documents and meat tainted with fecal matter, are outlined in U.S. 
Department of Agriculture records the newspaper obtained Thursday 
under the federal Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zeeland plant, owned by Chicago-based Sara Lee Corp., is  
under investigation by a federal grand jury and the U.S. Attorney's 
Office in Grand Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant on Dec. 22 recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and  
lunch meats sold under a variety of names -- the largest meat recall 
ever -- because of suspected contamination with a rare strain of the 
bacteria Listeria monocytogenes. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak has been linked to 15 deaths and six miscarriages  
or stillbirths. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee spokeswoman Theresa Herlevsen told the Free Press that  
the Zeeland plant had an inspection history that was typical. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a dirty plant,'' said. ``We have a lot of  
confidence in this facility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added that all problems found by inspectors were immediately  
corrected, noting that USDA officials in February called Bil Mar 
Foods a typical plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Company and government documents suggest that the USDA's on-site  
inspectors repeatedly cited the plant for failing to keep the plant 
clean and free of contamination on the hot dog processing lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant was repeatedly cited for having spots of old, dried  
meat or other debris on surfaces that came into contact with food -- 
despite the fact that the plant's workers had declared the area 
clean and ready for production, the Free Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
	On several occasions, inspectors observed chickens that were  
contaminated with feces. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak's cause has not been pinpointed. But the U.S.  
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has focused on a 
refrigeration unit in the ceiling of the hot dog processing room as 
a possible suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	That unit had been a major headache for the plant for the first  
half of 1998, the USDA records show. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors noted that condensation dripped from the ceiling onto  
hot dog processing machines, work surfaces and even directly on to 
hot dogs as they raced down the conveyor belt toward the final 
packaging machine. 
</P>
<P>
	The company removed the system in July, but that might have  
caused even more problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers had to cut the system in pieces with a chain saw to get  
the unit out, CDC sources told the paper, possibly spreading dust 
containing Listeria monocytogenes around the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria monocytogenes, a common bacteria, causes flu-like  
symptoms in most people but can be a serious threat to pregnant 
women, young children, older adults and people with weakened immune 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC estimates that in the United States each year, 1,850  
people become seriously ill with listeriosis. Of those, 425 die. 
</P>
<P>
	It can take up to eight weeks for symptoms to develop. The  
bacteria can be killed if food is heated thoroughly.
