Beijing's food safety office said 
Friday that it found the cancer-causing colorant, Sudan I, in a 
brand of pepper sauce brand in the city.
</P>
<P>
The pepper sauce, Meiweiyuan, produced by the Guangzhou-based 
Heinz Meiweiyuan Food Co. Ltd, was spotted after an inspection of 
17 brands of condiments by the city's food safety office, the 
entry-exit inspection and quarantine bureau, and the commerce 
bureau.

<P>
The producer, a subsidiary of the Heinz Company of the United 
States, has been ordered to recall its product.
</P>
<P>
The office said that the city will launch a broader sample 
inspection on foods produced by foreign companies and joint 
ventures.

<P>
Sudan-I is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oils, waxes, 
petrol and shoe and floor polishes. It cannot safely be used in 
food because it can contribute to an increased risk of cancer.
</P>
<P>
The dye was found by the Food Standards Agency of Britain on 
Feb. 18 in a batch of chili powder made by Premier Foods, one of 
the largest food and beverage companies in Britain. The agency 
also found some products of other companies, including Schweppes, 
Coca Cola, Unilever and Heinz, to contain Sudan-I.
