All KFC outlets in China stopped
selling New Orleans roast chicken wings and chicken hamburgers 
Wednesday after the cancer-causing food coloring, Sudan I, was 
found in the sauce Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released Wednesday by Yum, KFC's 
parent company, the remaining "unsafe" sauce will be destroyed. 
Yum did not release the name of the sauce supplier.
</P>
<P>
"We feel deep sorry for this food safety accident and promise 
it will never happen again," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said KFC have already found new sauce 
supplier and the New Orleans roast chicken wing is expected to be 
back on sale next week.
</P>
<P>
Sudan I is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oils waxes, 
petrol and shoe and floor polishes. It cannot safely be used in 
food as it can increase the risk of cancer.

<P>
Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) first stepped in the Chinese 
market in 1987. It now has 1,200 outlets in 260 cities nationwide.

<P>
In fact, KFC is not the only case in this "red colorant storm."
</P>
<P>
China launched a severe food safety inspection when Sudan I was
detected in a pepper sauce brand, Meiweiyuan, produced by the 
Guangzhou-based Heinz-Meiweiyuan Food Co., Ltd. The discovery was 
made in a routine inspection early this month and thousands boxes 
of the sauce were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
According to the China's General Administration for Industry 
and Commerce, food containing Sudan I had passed into China's 
municipalities, provinces and autonomous regions including Beijing
and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's food safety office announced Wednesday that not only 
the pepper sauce and the chili oil, but also all other flavoring 
products made by the Heinz-Meiweiyuan Food Co., Ltd. have been 
banned in the country's capital.
