<P>
The cancer-causing food coloring Sudan 
I has been found in other Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) products in 
China, state media said Monday, as the vastly popular fast food 
giant suspended sales.
</P>
<P>
The company's New Orleans chicken wings and chicken burgers were 
found to contain the red dye last week and since then the items have 
been removed from more than 1,000 of the eatery's outlets in China 
and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The banned dye was Friday also found in KFC's spice pickle 
powder, used in three KFC foods: spiced drumsticks, spiced chicken 
wings and chicken-flavored popcorn, the Beijing food safety office 
was quoted by Xinhua news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Beijing authorities have asked KFC to suspend sales of the three 
products until they pass inspections.
</P>
<P>
The food safety department in Hefei city, east China's Anhui 
province, meanwhile, has banned seven KFC outlets in the city from 
selling foods found to be tainted with Sudan I.
</P>
<P>
KFC and China's food safety officials could not immediately be 
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
China launched a food safety inspection when Sudan I was 
detected in a pepper sauce produced by a subsidiary of American 
company Heinz,  Heinz-Meiweiyuan Food Co., Ltd. in southern China's 
Guangzhou city earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
So far, state media said the dye has been found in 12 provinces 
and municipalities in China, sparking recalls of suspect products.
</P>
<P>
The suspect products all came from a raw materials provider, the 
Guangzhou-based Tianyang Food Co. Ltd., Chinese media had quoted 
China's General Administration for Industry and Commerce (GAIC) 
saying.
</P>
<P>
But so far the government has not listed other food producers 
affected other than KFC and Heinz.
</P>
<P>
Sudan I is a red dye traditionally used for coloring solvents, 
oils, waxes, petrol and shoe and floor polishes.
</P>
<P>
The dye, which was at the center of a European health scare, was 
found by the Food Standards Agency of Britain on February 18 in a 
batch of chilli powder made by Premier Foods, one of the country's 
largest food and beverage companies.
</P>
<P>
The agency also found the dye in products of companies such as 
Schweppes, Coca Cola and Unilever.
