Fast food giant KFC's Chinese

scares like the one this month over a cancer-causing dye found in 
its products, state press said Tuesday.

Yum! Restaurants China, the company that operates the US-based 
company's franchises on the mainland, would put up two million yuan 
(240,000 dollars) to ensure the safety of its food, the Shanghai 
Daily reported.

The announcement comes nearly two weeks after KFC pulled several 
products from its menus after it discovered Sudan I, a dye linked 
with to increased cancer risk, in the food.

"In the past, we required our suppliers to provide a license 
specifying food quality. After the Sudan I event, we decided to 
conduct stringent checks ourselves," the newspaper quoted Wang Qi, 
manager of Shanghai KFC, as saying.

<P>
All products and materials will undergo spot checks and 
suppliers have also been told to tighten supervision of their 
products, Wang said.

The dye, which was also at the center of a European health 
scare, was found in both KFC and Heinz products.

A manager of the Guangzhou-based Tianyang Food Co., found to be 
the source of the cancer-causing food coloring, has been detained.
