Sweden is prepared to freeze the
7.6 million-US dollar debt over the next two years owed by 
Indonesia, which was hard hit by last month's tsunami disaster, 
the Swedish finance minister announced on Wednesday.

<P>
"I welcome the G7 countries' decision to freeze debt payments 
from the Asian countries hit by the tsunami ... Sweden supports 
this," Finance Minister Paer Nuder said, referring to a decision 
made by the world's seven leading industrialized countries last 
Friday.

According to the minister, other countries affected by the 
tsunami that do not have any debt with Sweden will receive other 
forms of aid.

<P>
"The aim is for the countries to use their freed resources on 
humanitarian efforts and rebuilding. An important requirement is 
that all the freed resources be used to help the entire population
in the affected regions," the minister said.

<P>
Nuder also said Sweden would push for generous treatment of the
crisis-ridden Asian countries at a Paris Club meeting in Paris on 
Wednesday, where member countries are expected to propose a freeze
on debt repayments from Sri Lanka and Indonesia.

Sweden has pledged 73 million US dollars in aid to countries 
directly affected by the tsunami.
