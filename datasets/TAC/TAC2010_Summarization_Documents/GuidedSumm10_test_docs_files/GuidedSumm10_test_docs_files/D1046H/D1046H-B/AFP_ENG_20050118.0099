Last month's tsunami could reduce 
Indonesia's gross domestic product growth by 0.4 percent, but 
Indonesia's improving financial situation means it is in good stead 
to cope, the World Bank said Tuesday.

In a report published a day ahead of an annual meeting of donors 
from the Consultative Group on Indonesia, the financial body said 
disaster rebuilding costs could range up to 5.0 billion dollars.

The World Bank last November revised its forecast for 
Indonesia's 2005 GDP growth to 5.4 percent from 5.0, in line with 
government projections after a successful election year which 
installed a business-friendly president.

"Had the disaster come a few years earlier, the economic 
consequences would have been considerably more serious," the World 
Bank said in its report.

"But the progress in recovery and macroeconomic stabilisation 
over the last few years, and especially the important political and 
economic milestones achieved in 2004, have added resilience to the 
economy and positioned it better to absorb such massive shocks," it 
said.

Indonesia was the worst affected by the December 26 earthquake 
and tsunami disaster, with up to 115,000 people killed.
