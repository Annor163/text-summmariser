	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese police have begun a pitched battle against
an enemy in their own ranks: obesity.
	   Leading the fight are Japan's finest on the northern island of
Hokkaido. After routine check ups revealed about 60 percent of
officers were overweight, headquarters began handing out ``red
cards'' in June to those needing exercise, a police spokesman said
Monday.
	   It also announced a campaign to encourage officers to walk
10,000 steps a day for the next 100 days _ or one million steps by
the end of summer.
	   ``There are obvious problems to having overweight officers,''
said spokesman Yoshiharu Nakano. ``They can't carry out their jobs
as well.''
	   Police departments in at least six other prefectures have also
identified obesity as a problem and are taking steps to get
officers back in shape, Kyodo News reported Sunday.
	   The National Police Agency refused to comment on the report.
