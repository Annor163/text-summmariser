 By CHARLES DOWNEY  
 From Kiwanis magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jimmy, a 6-year-old first-grader, should have weighed about 50
pounds but pressed the scales to the 95-pound mark. At his school
near Baton Rouge, La., the lumbering lad always was dead last in
gym-class activities and any sports he played with fellow students.
 &HT;    Because of the flabby rolls that hung over his pants, Jimmy
suffered all the cruel taunts other children could heap on a boy
who weighed almost twice the normal weight.
 &HT;    Eventually, his physician referred him to a weight-loss clinic,
the Committed to Kids Pediatric Weight Management Program at
Louisiana State University in New Orleans.
 &HT;    One of his first prescription slips read: ``Play outside twice a
week for 20 minutes.'' This could entail walking, bicycling,
in-line skating or other common childhood pastimes. At first, it
was difficult for him to huff and puff through those 20 minutes,
but he slowly improved.
 &HT;    Like Jimmy, most obese children live in industrialized nations,
but cases of childhood obesity are found worldwide. American kids
top the childhood heavyweight list: One in four children ages 5 to
12 is 70 percent or more over his or her proper weight, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
 &HT;    Childhood obesity is partly caused by children being home alone
after school and snacking on whatever they want, as often as they
want. Also, more and more children have become couch potatoes who
routinely log four to six hours a day watching television or
playing video games.
 &HT;    Medical doctors, nutritionists and child-behavior specialists
are concerned about these trends, because obese children still are
growing and require certain nutrients for healthy physical and
mental development. Such growth may be stunted by high-fat diets
and sedentary lifestyles.
 &HT;    After a year at a weight-loss clinic, Jimmy worked up to doing
aerobic exercises and other physical activities for 45 minutes five
times a week. He _ along with his family _ also learned
much-improved nutritional habits and reduced his weight to 67
pounds.
 &HT;    But the big plus for Jimmy was constantly finishing first in
physical activities and sports at school. The cruel taunts stopped
when he began placing at the top.
 &HT;    Trading television for sports works, and many children need to
try it. The World Health Organization once surveyed Canadian
children and found that, outside school, the girls were active only
half an hour per week or less. One-fourth of the boys and girls
reported spending at least four hours a day in front of the tube.
 &HT;    ``We don't tell our young patients they must give up
television,'' says Uwe Blecker, medical director of the LSA
weight-loss clinic, ``but instead of watching television or playing
video games four hours a day, we ask them to reduce it to three. Or
we ask them to ride a stationary bike or walk on a treadmill while
watching television.''
 &HT;    It's all too easy for children to get their forks into one of
the biggest health hazards: fatty foods. Health professionals who
monitor the eating habits of young children have found that one
cheeseburger with fries can equal the total amount of fat a child
should consume in two days.
 &HT;    Children who must watch their weight are encouraged to consume
more whole grains, vegetables and fruits while cutting back on _
not eliminating _ dairy products, beef, pork, lamb and high-fat or
highly sugared treats.
 &HT;    Obesity has a genetic link. According to Canada's National
Institute of Nutrition in Ottawa, Ontario, if both parents tip the
scales at a normal weight, the probability of a child becoming
obese is about 10 percent. But if one parent is overweight, the
child's odds of matching that physical trait rise to 49 percent.
 &HT;    If both the mother and father are overweight, a child stands an
80 percent chance of becoming obese, due to a complex mix of
genetic and lifestyle factors that medical scientists don't fully
understand.
 &HT;    What medical science does understand about obesity is the
increased risk of more widespread health woes, such as the
development of diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis or skeletal
problems in hips and legs.
 &HT;    Studies reveal that portly children usually grow into pudgy
teens and adults. Each stage then brings its own woes. For
instance, University surveys and personality inventories show that,
as early as kindergarten, children have an aversion to obesity and
describe their overweight classmates as less likable, less capable
and less able to control themselves.
 &HT;    To curb childhood obesity, the American Pediatric Association
urges families to begin early with proper diets and exercise. When
overweight children learn to reduce and maintain weight through
good nutrition and exercise, the loss is more likely to be
permanent as they grow into young adulthood.
 &HT;    ``One of the primary causes of childhood obesity among our
patients is because families no longer sit down together for dinner
at a fixed time,'' says Baylor College's William Klish. ``Instead,
children eat in front of the television, after `grazing' all
afternoon. But when everybody in a family sits down for dinner at a
fixed time every night, fewer and healthier calories are consumed.
Also, today's children just don't play outside like they did in
years past.''
 &HT;    Families eat less when they eat together, because they talk and
that slows down the speed of eating, giving the stomach's fullness
signals a chance to work. Even small amounts of food will begin
sending satiety signals to the brain after about 20 minutes.
 &HT;    Children tend to lose weight more successfully when the entire
family is involved. Ideal loss for plump children is no more than
one-half to one pound per week.
 &HT;    ``When an overweight child starts watching the types of food he
or she eats, the rest of the family also must watch what they
eat,'' says Marilyn Day, a nutritionist at Children's Hospital in
Denver, Colo. ``It's unfair to forbid cookies and other treats to a
child while others in the home munch them.
 &HT;    ``I've found in my practice that a child often can lose unwanted
pounds through some very simple changes in ordinary foods that are
normally kept in the home,'' she adds. ``I've known children who
cut back from whole milk to skim milk or cut out the highly sugared
cola drinks and lost weight.''
 &HT;    Other researchers have uncovered an unexpected source of flab in
a study group of 168 children ages 2 to 5: fruit juice. In
Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, they
reported that children who drink at least 12 ounces of fruit juice
a day are more likely to be obese.
 &HT;    Young children worldwide are famous for being fussy eaters. More
than one serving of peas or spinach has ended up on the floor or
caused an evening-long power struggle between parents and children.
Studies have disclosed, however, that if caretakers introduce new
or more nutritious foods to young children too forcefully, it can
backfire.
 &HT;    Susan Johnson, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the
Center for Human Nutrition of the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center in Denver, found in a study of 77 youngsters ages 3
to 5 that those children with the most body fat also had the most
controlling mothers.
 &HT;    Johnson notes that, though parents still are responsible for
making sure that children eat healthful food, the ``children
themselves are capable of figuring out how much to eat.''
 &HT;    Her advice about clean plates? ``Relax a little.''
 &HT;    The study revealed that children whose mothers allowed them to
be spontaneous about food _ to eat when they are hungry and not
necessarily finish all the food given to them _ showed a natural
instinct for regulating their own calories.
 &HT;    So there may be hope for caregivers trying to make vegetables _
and other unfamiliar but healthful food _ more popular with young
children. After all, if it leads to better health via an
appropriate weight, what harm is there in a few servings of peas
and spinach on the dining-room floor?
