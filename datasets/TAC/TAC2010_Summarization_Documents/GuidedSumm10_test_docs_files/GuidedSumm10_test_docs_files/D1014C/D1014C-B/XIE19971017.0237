WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Americans spend 33 billion
dollars a year on weight-loss programs as every one out of three
has weight problems in the nation, but often they are not able to
evaluate them or know whether they are dangerous, participants in
a government conference were told today.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission and several private and government
health organizations sponsored the two-day conference on problems
arising from the increases in obesity and weight-control programs.
</P>
<P>
About 33 percent of the U.S. population was overweight today,
increased from 25 percent in the 1960s, Dean Graybill of the
commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection told the conference.
</P>
<P>
"Today, there are over 48 million Americans who are on some
sort of diet," Graybill said. "Obesity is a paramount public
policy and health concern."
</P>
<P>
Obesity contributes to over 300,000 excess deaths each year.
Next to smoking, obesity is the second-leading cause of
preventable death in the United States, according to President
George Blackburn of the American Society of Clinical Nutrition.
</P>
<P>
But some participants noted that there was lack of law
enforcement on the weight-loss programs that may raise risks.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers are left to guess about the cost, safety and
efficacy" of weight-loss regimes, said Leslie Byrne, director of
the U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Many at the conference called for greater consumer education to
reduce the risks of ineffective or fraudulent diet products and
programs.
</P>
<P>
Some participants charged the government response is inadequate
and criticized the government for exacerbating the problem by
letting dietary supplements be sold without sufficient testing.
