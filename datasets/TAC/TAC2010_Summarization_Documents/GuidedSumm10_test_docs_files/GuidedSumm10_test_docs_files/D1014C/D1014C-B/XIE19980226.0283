<HEADLINE> Pakistan Among Top 10 in Diabetes Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is among the top 10
countries in the world in terms of diabetes incidence rate.
</P>
<P>
A national survey conducted by the Diabetic Association of
Pakistan (DAP) reveals that there are now some 4.3 million
diabetics in Pakistan and the figure is likely to reach 14.5
million by 2025.
</P>
<P>
Chief coordinator of the survey, Abdus Samad Shera, told
journalists Wednesday that while Pakistan is trying to control
various infectious and preventable diseases, the triad of
hypertension, diabetes and obesity has emerged to be one of the
most common cause of morbidity and mortality in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Shera said the situation could be changed provided diabetes or
impaired glucose tolerance is detected earlier.
</P>
<P>
Since diabetes and hypertension can be controlled, emphasis
should be on prevention through awareness, screening and control,
he said.
