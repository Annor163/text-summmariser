RESEARCHER SEES DRAMATIC RISE IN DIABETES CASES

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ San Antonio has seen an explosion of new diabetes
cases in recent years, and if the rest of the country is following
suit, the result could be a reversal of a 30-year decline in heart
disease deaths, a Texas researcher said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings ``suggest that diabetes and obesity are likely to
emerge as the preeminent public health problems in the near
future,'' said Dr. Michael Stern, professor of medicine at the
University of Texas Health Science Center.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent findings from the 19-year-old San Antonio Heart
Study, which follows 5,100 adults around the South Texas city, show
the rate of new Type 2 diabetes cases rose by 9 percent per year on
average over the decade ending in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   New cases among Mexican Americans rose from 5.7 percent in 1987
to 15.7 percent in 1996. Among non-Hispanic whites, new cases rose
from 2.6 percent to 9.4 percent during the period.
</P>
<P>
   Stern presented his findings Sunday at the American Diabetes
Association's annual scientific meeting in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Type 2, or adult-onset diabetes, afflicting 90 percent of the
estimated 16 million American diabetics, arises because of an
inability by the body to use insulin produced by the pancreas.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is most often seen in people over age 45 who are
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   National surveys have shown an overall increase in diabetes, but
the latest data from the San Antonio Heart Study looked
specifically at newly diagnosed cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diabetics are surviving longer, so that by itself would
increase the number of cases. The population is aging, so the
number of cases is going up for a couple of reasons. But what we
measured was the actual development of new cases over a time
period.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Americans are getting heavier, obesity is not the whole
explanation for the increase, Stern said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Even after researchers adjusted their data to account for
differences in obesity, age, gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic
status, ``the trend for a rapid rise in diabetes incidence
remained,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities for the rise, Stern said, include a decline
in physical activity, which wasn't measured in the study; and some
undefined changes in diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because diabetes and obesity are major risk factors for
cardiovascular disease _ and both are increasing _ this escalation
may well eventually blunt or reverse the decline in heart disease
that has been under way in the United States since the 1960s if
trends similar to those in San Antonio are occurring nationwide,''
Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1960s, deaths due to heart disease have steadily
declined by about 50 percent, a reduction attributed to declines in
risk factors such as cholesterol, high blood pressure and cigarette
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all ethnic minorities suffer higher rates of Type 2
diabetes, but the San Antonio Heart Study focused on Mexican
Americans and non-Hispanic whites.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said the growing recognition of the threat posed by
diabetes would lead to more research funding, which when directed
against other risk factors for heart disease, led to improvements
in health.
</P>
<P>
   While the National Institutes of Health invests about $330 per
patient in heart disease research, it invests only about $20 per
patient for diabetes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diabetes has been kind of the poor stepchild of NIH funding. I
think there's been a sudden realization that this is a major public
health problem and needs to be addressed as such.''
