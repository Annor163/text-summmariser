BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Armed with new surveys showing
high rates of childhood anemia, obesity, and short stature,
nutritionists in Guangzhou are pushing for more attention to local
children's diets both at home and school.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent city survey, more than 40 percent of the
teenagers suffer from anemia caused by malnutrition and about 20
percent of middle school students are overweight, "China Daily"
reports today.
</P>
<P>
The survey says that Guangzhou teenagers, shorter than the
average national height of the same age group, are about 10 to 15
centimeters shorter than Japanese teens.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Yukun, a nutrition expert of the Guangzhou Science and
Technology Association, blamed unbalanced and dull food eaten
every day for the malnutrition-based health problems.
</P>
<P>
Rice, the main Cantonese food, contains much less nutrition
than that found in corn, wheat, potatoes and many other staples
popular in north China.
</P>
<P>
In Guangzhou, about 70 percent of the teenagers either have the
school lunch or buy lunch on the street nearby. And most school
cafeterias don't serve food containing the seven basic nutrients
students need every day, according to Zhong.
</P>
<P>
Many spoiled teenagers from one-child families eat only a
particular kind of food, such as meat or sweets, which might
easily lead them to develop obesity, diabetes or heart disease.
