<HEADLINE> Survey Shows One in Every Ten Shanghainese Overweight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- One out of every ten people in
Shanghai is overweight, mostly because of improved lifestyles and
poor eating habits.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey found that 12.6 percent of 4,895 adults and
11.35 percent of 9,093 children who live in urban Shanghai are
obese, and these figures are close to the average weight
proportion seen in developed countries, it was reported in today's
"Wen Hui Bao Daily."
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted jointly by the Xiangshan Hospital of
Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Nutrition and Food Research
Section of the Shanghai Medical Science University.
</P>
<P>
People in the 7-12 and 60-70 age groups run a greater risk of
becoming overweight, and incidence of obesity in males is higher
than in females, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
Educational background was also related to the incidence rate,
which is lower in well-educated people, especially in females.
</P>
<P>
About 70 million Chinese people, mostly city dwellers, are
obese, and the number is on the rise as people's living standards
have greatly improved in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Many of them gained unwanted pounds because they do not engage
in regular exercise, sleep too much and eat food that is high in
fat and calories, another survey of Beijing's overweight people
showed.
</P>
<P>
Experts warn people who are overweight have increased
tendencies toward cardiovascular and cerebral disease, diabetes,
and kidney and liver disease.
