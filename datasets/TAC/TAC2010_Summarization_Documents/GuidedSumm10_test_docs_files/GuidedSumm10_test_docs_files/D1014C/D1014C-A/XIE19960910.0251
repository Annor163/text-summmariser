<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A survey in Shanghai has
revealed that one in eight people in the city suffer from
overweight.
</P>
<P>
The study shows that the 12 percent obesity is close to the
standard in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The survey was carried out among nearly 14,000 people,
including 4,895 adults and over 9,093 young people from nine
districts in the city. It was conducted by Shanghai Medical
Sciences University and Shanghai Xiangshan Traditional Chinese
Medicine Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The research showed that the ratio of adults suffering from
obesity has reached 12.6 percent, and that of youngsters is 11.35
percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that differences in age, gender, and
education levels can influence the ratio of obesity.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen percent of female adults suffer from obesity, while the
level among male adults 10.68 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, more boys suffer from obesity than girls. The ratio of
boys is 14.7 percent, almost double that of girls.
</P>
<P>
Researchers found that children aged from seven to 12, and
people between aged 60 and 70, are easiest to fall victim to
obesity.
</P>
<P>
They also found that the higher education levels people have,
the less they are likely to suffer from obesity, especially among
women.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts suggested that citizens, especially people
suffering from obesity, should follow advice to change their life
styles and diets.
