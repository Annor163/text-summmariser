HONG KONG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A survey showed that Hong
Kong children were eating too much junk food, local press reports
revealed today.

The poll of 2,760 students' eating habits by the Chai Wan
Caritas Children and Youth Center found crisps, sweets,
chocolates, chips, chicken and other deep-fried food, ice-cream
and ice-lollies topped the list of favorite foods.

More than half the respondents spent up to five HK dollars
(0.64 US dollars) a day on junk food, and another 26 percent spent
between six to ten HK dollars (0.77 to 1.28 US dollars).

Most of the snacks were bought from their school tuck shops,
the survey showed.

<P>
Over 12 percent said they did not eat breakfast, and close to
30 percent were unsatisfied with their weight.

Head of the center, William Ng Man-sui, said concern over an
increasing number of young children with obesity problems had
prompted him to research the eating habits of upper-grade students
at all seven primary schools in Chai Wan, a district in the east
of Hong Kong island.

He urged schools to educate students about nutrition and a
balanced diet.
