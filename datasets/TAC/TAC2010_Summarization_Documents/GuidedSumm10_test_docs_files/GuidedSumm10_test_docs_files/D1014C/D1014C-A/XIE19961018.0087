successful experiment to rid extra fat in obese men and women in
Kuwait, a specialist said here today.

Kazen Abul, a social worker in close contact with the
experiment in the country, told Kuwait News Agency that
"hypnotherapy of obesity has made an unprecedented success in
Kuwait. The number of people coming to clinics for this
particular treatment is on the rise."

He said up to 700 obese people were satisfied with the
results of hypnotherapy.

700,000 citizens, especially women, because of less activities

Kuwait has started this medical experiment on obesity cases
recently. So far it is the third Arab country that has been using
this method after Egypt and Lebanon which have been applying the
treatment.

this therapy in many cases like anxiety and depression.

addicts, he said.
