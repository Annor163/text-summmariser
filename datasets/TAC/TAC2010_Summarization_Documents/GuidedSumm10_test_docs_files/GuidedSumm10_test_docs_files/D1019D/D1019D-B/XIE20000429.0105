MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and Malaysia have
stepped up their joint border patrols to intensify their
cooperation against trans-border crimes and prevent a repeat of
the April 24 Sabah hostage-taking incident, an official said here
Saturday.

Speaking in a radio-TV program, Undersecretary Esteban Conejos

Last Sunday, a group of kidnappers took hostage 21 persons,
including Filipinos and several foreigners from an island resort
in Sabah, Malaysia, and entered the Philippines' Jolo Island, Sulu
Province, where they are now believed to be hiding their captives.

"Because of this (hostage-taking) incident, we are intensifying
our joint patrol of the area with the Malaysian Navy," Conejos
