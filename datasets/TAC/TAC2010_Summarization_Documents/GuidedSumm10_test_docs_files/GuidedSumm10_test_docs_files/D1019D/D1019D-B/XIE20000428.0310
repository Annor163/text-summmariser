<HEADLINE> Philippine Official: Hostages' Release a Hoax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Philippine military
official has denied a report that eight Malaysians had been freed
in Sulu Province Thursday by their hostage-takers.
</P>
<P>
Jose Calimlim, vice-chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines said in an interview with the local ABS television
Thursday night that the report was a hoax.
</P>
<P>
The rumor floated after Governor Nur Misuari of the Autonomous
Region reportedly received word of the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
The eight Malaysians are among the 21 people abducted by
terrorists from the resort island of Sipadan in the Malaysian
state of Sabah Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim said that he had spoken with Misuari and the governor
also denied the report.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, the Philippine government has appointed
Misuari as chief negotiator for the safe release of 21 hostages,
who are now believed to be in Sulu province, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Misuari told reporters here that President Josep Estrada has
given him a "general and comprehensive" mandate to negotiate with
the hostage takers.
</P>
<P>
"I will try my best to help facilitate the safe and quick
release of these people," said Misuari.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the president has instructed the Armed Forces of
the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to fully
cooperate with him to ensure the welfare and safety of the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview Thursday morning, Executive Secretary
Ronaldo Zamora said the government will not accede to any ransom
demand from the kidnapers.
</P>
<P>
Misuari, head of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF),
said he will consult with the Office of the President regarding
any ransom demand but added: "Offhand, I do not like to entertain
any financial demand" from the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
The MNIF, once the country's largest Muslim rebel group, signed
a peace treaty with the government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Misuari said that as part of his strategy and to ensure that
the government negotiates from a position of strength, he will
place on alert some 2,000 to 3,000 MNLF members in the area where
the hostages are held.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said the hostages seized at Sipadan island
include Malaysians, Filipinos, Germans, French and Finnish
nationals, South Africans and a Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the governments of the foreign nationals kidnapped
have agreed not to make this an international issue.
</P>
<P>
He said the Malaysian, Finnish, and German ambassadors have
told Secretary Domingo Siazon of the Department of Foreign Affairs
that they are leaving it to the Philippine authorities to handle
the situation.
