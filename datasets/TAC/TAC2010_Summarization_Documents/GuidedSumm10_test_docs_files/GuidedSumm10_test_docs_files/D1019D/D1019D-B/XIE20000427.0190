appointed Wednesday by Philippine President Joseph Estrada as the
government's negotiator with the kidnappers.

Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado confirmed
Wednesday that the hostages abducted from Malaysia had been found
in Sulu province, about an hour's boat ride from Sipadan Island,
Malaysia where the abduction took place.

Mercado, who visited Sulu on Wednesday, also confirmed the
participation of the Muslim rebel group Abu Sayyaf in the
abduction.

are being moved around the town of Talipao, 16 km away from Jolo,
the capital city of Sulu.
