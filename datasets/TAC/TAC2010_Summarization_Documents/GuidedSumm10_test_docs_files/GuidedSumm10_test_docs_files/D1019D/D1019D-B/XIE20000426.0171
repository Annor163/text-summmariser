<HEADLINE> Local Officials Say Hostages Now in Philippines  (Eds: Update with Officials' quotes) </HEADLINE>

<P>
MANILA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A group of tourists who were
kidnapped from a Malaysian resort island Sunday are being held in
southern Philippines, local officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"They are here," Governor Abdusakur Tan of the southern
Philippine island province of Sulu was quoted by local reports as
saying. He added that a Philippine rebel commander is suspected
behind the abduction.  "The hostages are probably being held by
Galid Andang, the commander of the extremist Muslim group Abu
Sayyaf in the province,"Tan said.
</P>
<P>
But another report said that by now only 17 of the 20 hostages
have been detained while the location of the other three is not
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
The tourists were reportedly taken hostage late Sunday on a
remote resort island of Sipadan off the Sabah coast in eastern
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, a least 10 of those kidnapped
were foreign tourists, including French, German, South African,
Lebanese and Finnish nationals. The rest were Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports have confirmed that Philippine military
officials will go to Sulu island Wednesday to verify the
information and check the situation there.
</P>
<P>
According o Governor Tan, he will meet later Wednesday with
military officials, including Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado
and Vice Chief of Staff Jose Calimlim, to discuss whether to
negotiate for the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
Early Tuesday, the Abu Sayyaf group claimed responsibility for
the kidnapping of the 20 tourists in Malaysia. But later it
retreated from the claim.
</P>
<P>
As Abu Sayyaf's spokesman Abu Ahmad put it later Tuesday, he
was not certain the group was involved in the abduction in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, one of the two Muslim rebel groups fighting for
an independent Islamic state in the southern Philippines, is under
attack for holding 27 Filipinos hostage for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
Government troops have pounded several Abu Sayyaf camps with
rockets Tuesday in a bid to free the remaining 27 hostages. The
group reportedly captured some 50 people, mostly school children,
on March 20.
</P>
<P>
Early last week, the rebel group demanded that the Philippine
government press for the release of three Arabs jailed in the
United States, including Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993
bombing of the World Trade Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
However, the Abu Sayyaf claimed last Wednesday that it had
beheaded two of the hostages because their demand had been
rejected by the government. They also threatened to kill five more,
if the military does not stop its attack.
