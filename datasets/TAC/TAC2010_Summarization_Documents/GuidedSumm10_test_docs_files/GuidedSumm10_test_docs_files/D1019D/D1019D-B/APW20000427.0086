<HEADLINE> Southeast Asia Waters Hide Rebels  </HEADLINE>

   MATAKING ISLAND, Malaysia (AP) -- The powder-white beach here is
untouched, save for the twigs and darkened kelp washed ashore from
waters teeming with coral reefs and tropical fish.
</P>
<P>
   Mataking Island -- one of hundreds peppering the waters between
Malaysia and the Philippines -- is an ideal retreat for a holiday
getaway, or a hide-out for pirates like the ones who abducted 21
foreign tourists and resort workers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Since nabbing their hostages from nearby Sipadan Island in
Malaysia five days ago, the kidnappers have released no one. A
former Muslim rebel leader negotiating for the Philippine
government said he would meet Friday with representatives of the
captors to try to win the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
   Sipadan itself is now sealed to the public and press, while
investigators question its resort workers about the kidnapping. But
other inlets in the vast Sulu and Celebes seas still provide
pirates ideal getaways.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, six armed captors in two wooden fishing boats
abducted the hostages and fled along this very route to similar
islands in the southern Philippines. The victims include citizens
of Germany, France, South Africa, Finland, Lebanon, the Philippines
and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian police intelligence reports indicate that the
abductors split up into smaller groups, and have been hopskotching
from one island to another in a bid to avoid the hundreds of police
swarming the area.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers, apparently connected to extremist Muslim
insurgents in the Philippines, have demanded a $2.4 million ransom
for the hostages, who are being held somewhere on the islands of
Sulu province in the Philippines, officials said. So far, neither
the Philippines nor Malaysia has said it would negotiate a ransom.
</P>
<P>
   This hostage-taking, along with another one month ago in which
rebels took 27 people, has drawn wide attention to the Philippines'
quarter-century Muslim separatist rebellion, which has taken more
than 120,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Former rebel leader Nur Misuari, the Philippines' negotiator in
the crisis, urged the military Thursday not to threaten the Sipadan
kidnappers while the talks were under way. Announcing he would meet
with the rebel captors Friday, Misuari said the kidnappers saw the
hostages as a treasure, and were unlikely to release them quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they will cling tooth and nail to these people just to
be able to optimize their gain,'' Misuari told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But military Deputy Chief of Staff Jose Calimlim said the
military had prepared a ''contingency'' action plan.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers have launched an attack against the Muslim extremists'
southern stronghold to free the 27 hostages taken earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But while both kidnappings have been blamed on the same group,
the Abu Sayyaf, Philippine officials said they may not be related.
</P>
<P>
   Calimlim said the motive of the Malaysian kidnapping appeared to
be money, while the abductors in the earlier case have made
ideological demands, including the release of three Arab terrorists
jailed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the attack on Sipadan had been planned for nearly a month,
indicating it was not intended to coincide with the hostage rescue
attempt, a police report said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, local authorities have continued to search the
watery maze of islands for pirates and kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   On Mataking, at the edge of Malaysian waters off Borneo,
fourteen Malaysian policemen armed with M-16 rifles scour the seas
with binoculars for passing boats traversing one of the sea
channels between Malaysia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Mataking's small marine force is part of Malaysia's effort to
combat piracy, which has become so serious in the area that the
London-based International Maritime Bureau in 1992 set up a
regional piracy center in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-acre island just three miles west of the international
border is the marine force's frontier outpost. Barbed wire and
sandbagged gun positions run the length of the otherwise pristine
shoreline, and briefings are held in a tin-roofed shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Sipadan kidnapping, patrolling has intensified, said
the head of the force, Inspector Daud, dressed in shorts and beach
sandals, his assault rifle close at hand.
</P>
<P>
   But despite treaties between the Southeast Asian neighbors to
fight piracy, the police officers on Mataking said they'd never
been part of any joint patrol of the waters, considered some of the
world's most dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have never seen any Philippine patrol boats, even on their
side of this border,'' said one Malaysian marine policeman, who
would give his name only as Hamid.
