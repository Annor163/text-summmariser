<HEADLINE> Philippine Army Finds No trace of Hostages Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government forces have
not found trace of the 27 hostages when they reached the peak of
the mountain stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf in Sumisip, Basilan,
Friday, after a day long fierce gunbattle, a military official
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But Major General Diomedio Villanueva, commander of the Armed
Forces of the Philippines based in Zamboanga City, Mindanao, said
that he is hopeful that the hostage-crisis can be resolved
Saturday or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We hope and pray that the hostages are safe and still alive,"
he said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he was optimistic that the other hostage-
crisis in Sulu where bandits with links with the Basilan-based Abu
Sayyaf extremists, would be resolved without bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The Sulu hostages were seized by Filipino gunmen in a diving
resort of Sipadan in Sabah, Malaysia last Sunday and brought them
over to Talipao, Sulu two days later.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for the release of the Sulu hostages have started
by Governor Nur Misuari of the Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao (ARMM).
</P>
<P>
Villanueva said authorities have still to pinpoint the exact
location of the hostages who were reportedly divided into three
groups, spread either in Talipao and Patikul.
</P>
<P>
He said government troops have occupied about 80 percent of the
Abu Sayyaf stronghold, but found no traces of the 27 hostages held
captive by the Muslim extremist group since March 20.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf claimed they have beheaded two of the hostages
but this could not be confirmed by the military until now.
</P>
<P>
Villanueva said there are still 27 hostages who are the object
of a rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
There are reports that the Abu Sayyaf have secret tunnels in
the area which they used to escape during the heavy bombardment
and air strikes by the military.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Abu Sayyaf planted landmines in many areas to
prevent and slow down the advancing troops toward Camp Abdurajak.
</P>
<P>
Five government soldiers were killed and 31 others wounded
during the final assault of Camp Adurajak.
