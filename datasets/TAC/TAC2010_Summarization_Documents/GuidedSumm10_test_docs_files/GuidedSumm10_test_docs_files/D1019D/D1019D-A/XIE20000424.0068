MANILA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Monday ordered the Philippine military forces to go after
the six armed pirates who reportedly kidnapped some 20 people,
mostly foreigners, in eastern Malaysia, a senior Philippine
official said.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing, Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said the
Philippine embassy in Kuala Lumpur has received a note from the
assistant director of the Malaysian Police informing the
Philippines of the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
The tourists were reportedly taken hostage late Sunday on a
remote resort island of Sipadan off the Sabah coast, eastern
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
But Puno, who is also the presidential spokesman, said initial
reports from the Philippine National Police could not confirm if
the pirates were Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Malaysian police report, Puno said 10 of those
kidnapped were foreign tourists, which include French, German,
South African, Lebanese and Finnish nationals.
</P>
<P>
According the report, five staff members of the Sipadan resort,
and a Filipino, a Malaysian policeman and four staffers of the
Malaysian wildlife department, were also among the abducted.
</P>
<P>
Puno said the hostages were reportedly taken by boats heading
toward Philippine waters early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
He added that President Estrada had given the instructions to
the Philippine Navy and the Philippine Air Force in support of the
border patrol agreement between the Philippines and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"There is a border patrol agreement between the Philippines and
Malaysia which has been activated and so elements of both
countries are in operation in that area," Puno said.
