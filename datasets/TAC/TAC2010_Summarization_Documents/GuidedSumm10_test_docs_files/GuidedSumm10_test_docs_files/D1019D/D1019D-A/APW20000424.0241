<HEADLINE> Americans Escape Hostage Abduction  </HEADLINE>

   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- James and Mary Murphy were just
another American couple escaping on a dream vacation to a lush
Malaysian resort island.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they arrived at the Kuala Lumpur International
Airport late Monday, they were among the few escapees of a mass
abduction by mysterious gunmen 24 hours earlier which left 20
hostages still missing in Southeast Asian waters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really need to talk to our children,'' Mary Murphy told The
Associated Press at Malaysia's international airport. ''We really
want to get to the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Murphys, both 51, of Rochester, N.Y., appeared shaken up and
very much alone. Scores of reporters waited for them to arrive, but
no Malaysian authorities or U.S. embassy officials were there to
escort them from their plane after their long ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Murphy, wearing plaid Bermuda shorts, was close to tears.
They had not yet informed their three children living in Boston,
Rochester and Australia about their trauma. The Murphys have been
living in Sydney for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Six gunmen stormed the Sipadan Island Resort off the eastern
Malaysian state of Sabah late Sunday, taking 20 people, including
10 foreign tourists, hostage on two boats.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue teams searching southeast Asian seas say they've zeroed
on assailants -- an attack that the Philippine rebel group Bbu
Sayyaf on Tuesday claimed it carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim rebels in the Philippines who are seeking the release of
militants jailed in the World Trade Center bombing case claimed
responsibility Tuesday for the Malaysian kidnapping. But Philippine
officials quickly expressed skepticism over the statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Murphys escaped by refusing to get on the boats, according
to police in Semporna. Eyewitnesses said the hostages were forced
to swim to the boats. They said Mary Murphy couldn't swim and when
the kidnappers tried to force her, her husband said they'd have to
shoot him if they forced her into the water.
</P>
<P>
   When the hostage-takers turned around, the Murphys ran into the
bushes and hid until dawn, eyewitnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if this was an accurate account, the Murphys smiled
but would not elaborate. Asked if they had hidden in the bushes,
Murphy said, ''We did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, an executive for Eastman Kodak Co. in Sydney, said they
had not slept since the previous night but were otherwise fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's got lots of bites from sleeping in the bushes, a lot of
sand fleas,'' he said, pointing to Mary Murphy's legs, which were
covered with a rash of insect bites.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said that he would speak more extensively once he knew
that the other hostages were released and safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to do anything that would endanger their lives,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As cameras flashed around them, Mary Murphy said all she wanted
now was ''a good night's sleep and a hot shower.''
