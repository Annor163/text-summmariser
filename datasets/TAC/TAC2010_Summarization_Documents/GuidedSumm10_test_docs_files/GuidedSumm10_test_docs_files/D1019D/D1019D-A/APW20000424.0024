<HEADLINE> 21 Held Hostage on Malaysian Island  </HEADLINE>

   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Six masked assailants have taken
more than 20 people, including Americans and Europeans, hostage on
a remote resort island in eastern Malaysia, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The abductors surprised and captured the group on a beach on
Sipadan Island late Sunday, and two foreign tourists managed to
escape the men, Semporna police chief Sulaiman Junaidi told The
Associated Press by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Osman Ibrahim, a police spokesman in the Malaysian capital,
Kuala Lumpur, confirmed that the two who escaped were Americans and
that they were still in Sabah. He said most of the hostages were
Europeans and Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Sipadan, popular for diving, is an island off the northeast
coast of Sabah, the Malaysian side of Borneo island, which is
shared with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Sulaiman said the assailants were believed to be Filipinos. The
hostages were said to have been taken onto a boat and are now at
sea.
</P>
<P>
   Police are currently trying to trace the boat, he said. He said
no demands had been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Chong Kah Kiat, the minister of tourism and environment for
Sabah, said the island was near two Malaysian naval bases on the
eastern coast of Sabah.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has never happened here before, so I don't think there
are any Malaysians involved,'' in the hostage taking, Chong said.
</P>
<P>
   Chong said the area was considered one of the top 10 diving
spots in the world and that six resorts on the island cater mostly
to professional divers.
</P>
<P>
   He said access to the island was restricted to 80 divers at one
time, and 40 staff at the six resorts, to protect the coral reef
and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia and Indonesia both claim sovereignty over the Celebes
Sea islands. The Southeast Asian neighbors have both filed claims
with the International Court of Justice at The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The argument over the islands dates back to 1969, when Indonesia
and Malaysia failed to reach agreement during technical discussions
about the overlapping continental shelf that borders the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no early indications that the assailants were
involved in the territorial dispute.
