Md. Governor Announces Oyster Habitat Program
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $19.4 million plan to reduce pollution and restore bay grasses
and oyster habitat to the Corsica River was announced by Maryland
Governor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. Tuesday as a ``blueprint'' for saving
the Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
``We are embarking upon an unprecedented environmental effort,''
Ehrlich, R, said Tuesday, surrounded by federal, state and local
officials at a site overlooking the Eastern Shore river. Fouled over
the years with millions of gallons of untreated sewage that once
flowed from an antiquated treatment plant in Centreville, the river
travels east from Centerville and into the bay just north of the Bay
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
The plant in Centreville has been rebuilt. And the Corsica River
Pilot Project unveiled Tuesday aims to further reduce pollution
through improved technology and farming practices. Millions of young
oysters are being planted on oyster bars in the river as part of the
project, grasses that provide oxygen and habitat for marine life are
being restored, and monitoring for water quality will be stepped up,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
In an separate effort, officials also announced Tuesday a plan to
sell bottled ``Maryland Natural Spring Water'' in restaurants and
stores to raise money for cleaning up the bay.
</P>

Will Baker, president of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, called the
Corsica River initiative a positive step. ``We hope it will be a model
to lead to a similar approach to the entire Chesapeake Bay,'' he said,
noting that that job would be vast compared with the cleanup of a
single river.
</P>
<P>
The Chesapeake Bay watershed covers 64,000 square miles and
includes parts of six states. ``Between $10 (billion) and $12 billion
over the next 10 years would get 80 percent of the job done,'' Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
Democrats dismissed Tuesday's announcements as mere window
dressing.
</P>
<P>
``This is like saying you need to replenish a beach and showing up
with five grains of sand,'' said Maryland Democratic Party spokesman
Derek Walker. He said the governor has stood by while the Bush
administration has cut environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
``They've gutted all the programs to save the Bay,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
The Corsica River Pilot Project is being funded with a combination
of state, federal and private money, said Maryland Department of
Natural Resources spokeswoman Megan Evans.
