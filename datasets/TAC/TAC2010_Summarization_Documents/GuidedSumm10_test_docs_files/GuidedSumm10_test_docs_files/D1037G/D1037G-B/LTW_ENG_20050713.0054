New England's tide of misfortune is giving a small boost to
Maryland's tiny clamming industry.
</P>
<P>
Red tide, a toxic algae outbreak that renders affected clams
dangerous to eat, has swept the coast from Massachusetts to Maine,
forcing people who want the deep-fried soft-shells to look elsewhere
for them.
</P>
<P>
Some restaurants are looking south to the Chesapeake Bay, where
clams have long taken a back seat to crabs and oysters. This year,
Maryland's few clammers are finding an eager market to the north
that's willing to pay more than usual for their harvest.
</P>
<P>
``They want all we can get right now,'' said Bill Boulter, a
longtime clammer who works his boat, the Emma and Sara, in the waters
near Kent Island. ``The market's been open for weeks, ever since the
red tide hit, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
From the 1960s until the early 1980s, hundreds of clam boats plied
the Chesapeake and the coastal bays in what was a multimillion-dollar
industry. But shellfish diseases, state regulations and increased
pollution severely have cut into clamming.
</P>
<P>
The Maryland Department of Natural Resources estimates that the
clam harvest has dropped from 680,000 bushels at its peak in 1965 to
fewer than 1,000 bushels last year. Only about 30 clammers still work
the state's waters.
</P>
<P>
For those who have stuck with it, the increased northern demand is
a welcome change.
</P>
<P>
Boulter, who also owns Wild Goose Seafood in Arnold, Md., said the
average clammer is working more and is catching six to 10 bushels a
day. Three times a week, Boulter ships his clams to New England. He
works with only a few loyal buyers and isn't taking new customers. But
with the demand high, he says, he's selling everything he's catching.
</P>
<P>
``There's a little bit of money to be made right now. We're doing
as well now as we've done in a good while, thank the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
Clammer Mike Hamilton said he isn't taking new customers, either:
``I got a couple of them from up there calling me, but I can't handle
them because I've had one buyer on Cape Cod that's taking all I can
get.''
</P>
<P>
He said he's catching about 11 bushels a day aboard his boat, the
Henchman. On Monday, he shipped 38 bushels to Massachusetts. And he's
getting $100 a bushel this year -- about 10 percent more than usual.
</P>
<P>
Businesses including David's Place in Chesterfield, Conn., are
happy to pay a premium for the hard-to-come-by soft-shells.
</P>
<P>
``The price was high anyway this year. All the clams are high,''
said David's owner Sokratis Athanasiadis.

The soft-shell clam, Mya arenaria, lives along the Atlantic Coast
from Cape Hatteras to Canada, although the species can taste different
from place to place because of variations in salinity.
</P>
<P>
Some New Englanders in the past have looked down at the Maryland
clam because it's larger and slightly mushy. But Athanasiadis said
such snobbery isn't coming into play this year -- partly because of
the scarcity, partly because Chesapeake clams are smaller than usual.
</P>
<P>
``When you have 1,000 customers, each has a different opinion, but
percentage-wise, they like the Maryland whole clams,'' Athanasiadis
said. ``They are nice and juicy.''

Last month, the Fisheries Service of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration closed a portion of federal waters off New
Hampshire and Massachusetts to the harvesting of all shellfish except
scallops because of the red tide, which federal officials say is the
largest algal bloom in New England history that has warranted a public
health emergency.
</P>
<P>
Red tides are an explosion of microscopic plankton that turn water
a reddish brown and contaminate many filter-feeding species. Although
Maryland waters often have problems with algae, the state is not
susceptible to red tides.
</P>
<P>
The demand for clams is bittersweet along the Chesapeake because
many watermen have gotten out of the business.
</P>
<P>
Larry Simns, president of the Maryland Watermen's Association and a
former clammer, predicts that the bounty won't last past July because
dermo -- the parasite that has all but wiped out the oyster population
-- is fast infecting clams. State biologists say the clams are also
susceptible to disseminated neoplasia, a type of blood cancer.

Some clammers say they are missing out on the uptick in business
because of a 1998 law passed by the Maryland General Assembly that
banned clam dredging in all Chesapeake and coastal bay grass beds. The
law was passed after scientists found scarring in the aquatic grass
beds from the hydraulic rigs used in clam dredging.
</P>
<P>
Since then, James Patrick Reese Jr.'s clam equipment has sat idle.
The owner of Southern Connection Seafood in Crisfield said he can no
longer clam in the coastal bays.
</P>
<P>
``We don't do any local clams anymore,'' Reese said. ``I took the
blow. It knocked us back a little bit. And then we found other ways to
make money.''

Soft-shell clams are a versatile staple in New England, equally at
home fried on a roll at a roadside carry-out or dressed up on a white
linen tablecloth at a fancy bistro.
</P>
<P>
But they're a taste Marylanders have never really acquired.
</P>
<P>
That might be because soft-shells look different from hard-shells
-- they squirt water from their bellies and sport a tail. But the lack
of appreciation here also might stem from culture and tradition, said
DNR biologist Mitch Tarnowski.
</P>
<P>
In Maryland, where soft-shell clams tend to be found in deeper
waters, catching them requires a specialized boat and an expensive
hydraulic dredge. In New England, the clams are tidal and families can
wade out to get them using rakes.
