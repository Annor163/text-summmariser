<HEADLINE> Defense of Mailbomb Terrorist Suspect Seeks Large </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers for UNABOMber suspect
Theodore Kaczynski are asking for special measures to find
northern California jurors who aren't biased against him by news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski, the 55-year-old former university math instructor is
suspected of being the UNABOMber, the mailbomb terrorist who
killed three people and injured 23 others in 17 years before his
arrest last year. The UNABOMber was so named because his early
targets were universities and airlines.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys Quin Denvir and Judy Clarke have asked that
prospective jurors for the November 12 trial in Sacramento,
California, be picked from within the Eastern District, which
includes Sacramento and 22 other counties, according to news
reports.
</P>
<P>
Their 1,600-page motion also asks the pool to be taken from
licensed drivers rather than voter registration lists typically
used in federal trials.
</P>
<P>
Denvir and Clarke want prospective jurors to complete detailed
questionnaires about their knowledge of the case and their
feelings about the death penalty, which the government is seeking
against Kaczynski.
</P>
<P>
The attorneys say the 17-year case has prompted more news
coverage than any other in history, including 341 New York Times
articles between June 1993 and May 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski is charged in Sacramento with four of 16 bombings,
which killed two men and wounded two others. He is charged with a
third death in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say they expect to take up to four weeks to present
evidence showing that Kaczynski is the UNABOMber.
