<HEADLINE> Jury Selection in Unabomber Trial Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Jury selection for the trial
of suspected Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski is under way in
Sacramento, California, with an unprecedented number of nearly 600
prospective jurors to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that several hundred prospects may be eliminated
quickly because the trial and selection process could cause the
trial to last for six months, including the jury courtroom
selection, which is scheduled to begin November 12.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys are hopeful they can impanel 12 impartial jurors and
six alternates to decide the fate of Kaczynski, a 55-year-old
former college math instructor, who was arrested at a remote
Montana cabin last year, United Press International reported.
</P>
<P>
He is charged in Sacramento with placing or mailing four bombs
that killed computer store owner Hugh Scrutton in 1985 and timber
lobbyist Gilbert Murray in 1995, and with injuring two scientists
in the San Francisco Bay area and in Connecticut in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski is also charged with another fatal bombing in a
separate case in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Garland Burrell Jr. has ordered that
jurors' identities in the Sacramento trial be kept secret, but
said they won't be sequestered.
