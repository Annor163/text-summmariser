<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Unabomber suspect Theodore
J. Kaczynski pleaded innocent today via video to charges he sent
the mail bomb killing an advertising executive exactly two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski's plea from California was made through a live hookup
to the federal courthouse in Newark, New jersey, where Judge
Dickinson R. Debevoise presided in a courtroom, The Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Among those present was Susan Mosser, whose 50-year-old
husband, Thomas, was killed when he opened a package containing a
bomb on December 10, 1994, in his northern New Jersey home.
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, California, where Kaczynski has been jailed
since early summer, the U.S. Marshals Service moved Kaczynski to
the county public defender's office for the cross-country
arraignment.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski, the former Berkeley mathematics professor, has
pleaded innocent to four Unabomber attacks that killed two people
in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have said they hope to decide before January
whether to seek the death penalty, which Kaczynski could also face
for the two California bombing deaths.
</P>
<P>
Debevoise also heard arguments on a defense request to transfer
the New Jersey case to Sacramento, where a November trial date has
been set. Kaczynski's lawyers are seeking a single trial there on
all the Unabomber charges.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski, 54, was arrested April 3 at his cabin in Lincoln,
Montana, and is being held without bail.
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities believe he used bombs to kill three people
and injure 23 others between 1978 and 1995.
