<HEADLINE> Judge Keeps Jury Anonymous in Mail-Bomb Terrorist Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The names, addresses and
employers of jurors and their spouses will be kept secret once the
Unabomber murder trial gets under way with jury selection on
November 12 in Sacramento, California.
</P>
<P>
Unabomber, the mail bomb terrorist, killed three people and
injured 23 others between 1978 and 1995. The suspect, Theodore
Kaczynski, a 55-year-old former University of California math
instructor, is charged with four of the 16 attacks attributed to
the Unabomber, two of which are fatal. He is also charged with a
third fatal bombing in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. issued that order today
in denying a news media motion to make juror names public,
according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
Media Attorney Charity Kenyon argued there isn't enough
evidence showing they will be harassed, endangered or influenced
if the public and news media knew who they are.
</P>
<P>
But Burrell disagreed, saying that threats to witnesses in the
18-year Unabomber case "raise the specter that juror safety is
potentially at risk."
</P>
<P>
He also said reports of harassment against witnesses --
submitted by attorneys on both sides of the case -- meet the test
for juror anonymity spelled out by the 9th U.S. Circuit, which may
be asked to overturn his order.
</P>
<P>
One report by federal defender Quin Denvir said the names and
addresses of 18 supposed Unabomber witnesses were publicly
distributed in July with the suggestion that they be contacted and
scared as a game.
</P>
<P>
Burrell said the length of the trial, which is expected to last
up to six months, makes it impractical to pursue alternatives to
an anonymous jury, including sequestering jurors or moving the
trial to another city.
</P>
<P>
The court has contacted about 600 prospects for the 12-member
jury, with six alternates, so far.
