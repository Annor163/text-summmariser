UNBOWED UNABOMBER PITCHES BOOK IDEA TO PUBLISHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL TAYLOR  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Far from disappearing silently into the
anonymous maw of a federal prison, confessed Unabomber Theodore
Kaczynski is busy pitching a New York publisher and writing a
Chicago documentary producer about his plans for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski says he wants to ``cross swords'' with government
prosecutors and FBI agents in an effort to clear his name. It is
doubtful, however, that he will ever get a chance to do so because
as far as everyone else in the case is concerned _ prosecutors,
defense attorneys and the judge _ the Unabomber case is over.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaczynski is still trying.
</P>
<P>
   Simon and Schuster, the big New York publishing house, said it
got a four-page proposal from Kaczynski, in which the 56-year-old
former mathematics professor said he wanted to write a book ``about
how he was portrayed and how he was misrepresented.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think the world wants Theodore Kaczynski's point of
view on Theodore Kaczynski? I kind of doubt it,'' Simon and
Schuster executive Bob Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm sent a form letter rejecting Kaczynski's proposal to
his Florence, Colo., prison cell.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, Kaczynski pleaded guilty to killing three men and
injuring two others in a bombing campaign that terrorized the
nation between 1978 and 1995. On May 4, U.S. District Judge Garland
Burrell Jr. sentenced Kaczynski to four life terms in prison
without the possibility of release.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell also said Kaczynski could not profit from his crimes
through publishing books, giving interviews or anything else that
could earn him money.
</P>
<P>
   Besieged by reporters ever since he was arrested April 3, 1996,
at his remote cabin in Lincoln, Mont., Kaczynski has, for the most
part, refused to respond to media requests for interviews, let
alone grant any.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, however, Towers Productions received a letter from
Kaczynski this week turning down their request for an interview
with the serial bomber. Towers is co-producing a one-hour
documentary on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Chronicle,
Kaczynski said it ``would be disadvantageous'' to give an interview
now because ``I am still a long way from completing the analysis of
documents that will enable me to cross swords with the prosecutors,
the FBI, the shrinks, and certain others who have misrepresented
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to finish the work at some time within the next several
months,'' he wrote, ``and I will then be able to back up my points
with solid evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile, the public would do well to reserve judgment about
me and about the UNABOM case,'' Kaczynski wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That last thought is almost exactly what he said when the judge
gave him an opportunity to speak during his sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   As for the possibility that Kaczynski could reopen his case,
federal prosecutors have said the time for that is long past since
he agreed to an ``unconditional plea,'' which means he gave up his
right to appeal any aspect of his arrest or pretrial litigation.
