LAWYERS URGE RELEASE OF REPORT ON UNABOMBER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The public is entitled to know more about the
Unabomber, his crimes and how the criminal justice system worked in
his case, a lawyer told a federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing for release of a 47-page report detailing Theodore
Kaczynski's mental state, attorney Roger Myers told the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco that disclosure was
necessary for the public to understand ``the entire workings of the
criminal justice system in this case and understand the Unabomber
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The report will help explain how decisions were made in the
case, including the finding that Kaczynski was competent to stand
trial and the subsequent plea agreement in January that abruptly
ended the trial, said Myers, who represents the San Francisco
Examiner, CBS News and the Sacramento Bee.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski, 55, pleaded guilty to killing three people and
wounding dozens of others in a 17-year bombing spree. He was
sentenced to four consecutive life sentences without the
possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   Despite skeptical questioning from at least two judges,
Kaczynski attorney Quin Denvir maintained that the confessed
Unabomber still had a right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you have committed a criminal act doesn't open up
your mind to the public and the media,'' said Denvir, a federal
public defender.
</P>
<P>
   Denvir also argued that disclosure of the report based on 19
hours of interviews with Kaczynski would have a chilling effect on
defendants' willingness to divulge personal information in future
cases.
</P>
<P>
   However, during the hour-long hearing, at least two judges
indicated release of the report, which concluded Kaczynski was a
paranoid schizophrenic but nevertheless was competent to stand
trial, would perhaps contribute to the public's understanding of
how the courts operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to get as much (public) information as possible about
what goes on in the judicial system,'' Judge Stephen Reinhardt
said. ``We try to let the public know how the system operates.''
</P>
<P>
   The court, which delayed a trial judge's order releasing an
edited version of the report, did not immediately issue a ruling
and postponed any decision until after July 7.
</P>
<P>
   The report by federal prison psychiatrist Dr. Sally Johnson was
submitted in January.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Myers said that Kaczynski, who is
shopping around for a proposal for a book he intends to write about
himself and his case, wasn't interested in preserving his privacy
but rather sought ``to control what facts are reported to the
public, who gets to publicize them and the manner of their
presentation.''
