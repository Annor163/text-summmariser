Environmentalists buy big game hunting licence in Canada

<P>
Foreign big-game hunters will 
be banished from a vast area of western Canadas wilderness, local 
environmentalists said, announcing an unusual purchase of a 
commercial hunting licence.
</P>
<P>
The Raincoast Conservation Foundation privately raised 1.35 
million Canadian dollars (1.17 million US) to buy one of North 
Americas largest guide outfitters, Bella Coola Outfitters Company, 
said Chris Genovali of Raincoast.
</P>
<P>
"We bought exclusive rights for the commercial trophy hunting of 
a wide range of species in perpetuity," said Genovali.
</P>
<P>
The licence covers a vast area of 20,000 square kilometres 
(7,700 square miles) on the central coast of British Columbia, 
Canadas westernmost province.
</P>
<P>
Wild creatures who live there include carnivores such as grizzly 
and black bears, a mutant white bear that native groups call the 
spirit bear, wolves and  cougars. 
</P>
<P>
There are also thousands of ungulates, including mountain goats, 
moose and deer.
</P>
<P>
From now on, instead of catering to sports hunters, the 
outfitting company will focus on eco-tourism, arranging travel 
packages for tourists who wish to watch and photograph bears and 
other animals, said Genovali.
</P>
<P>
Six aboriginal groups supported the conservation groups 
purchase, appearing with Raincoast spokespersons at a news 
conference Tuesday in this west coast city.
</P>
<P>
Genovali said it was largely because of the commercial grizzly 
bear hunt, which brought foreign tourists to the province to bag 
trophies, that Raincoast decided to buy a guide out-fitter.
</P>
<P>
"Grizzlies are the slowest-reproducing mammal on the continent," 
said Genovali. "The impact of trophy hunting and overkill can be 
significant." 
</P>
<P>
The hunt has long been contentious, with threatened boycotts by 
international tourist groups, a ban on imported grizzly bear parts 
by the European Union, and efforts by conservationists to stop sport 
hunting.
</P>
<P>
No one knows the exact population of the giant carnivores, said 
Genovali. Some biologists put their number at 8,000, while current 
government estimates say there are as many as 16,000. 
</P>
<P>
"But none of that is based on peer-reviewed science," he said.
</P>
<P>
To keep a commercial licence, which is issued by the provincial 
government of British Columbia and can be bought and sold, guide 
outfitters have to continue to use it.
</P>
<P>
"We will do what we have to do to maintain our licence in good 
stead," said Genovali. "If that means hunting ungulates, for 
instance, we will do it. But we will not be hunting large 
carnivores."
</P>
<P>
He said Raincoast and the aboriginal bands are lobbying the 
government to change the terms of the licence.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government, based in the capital of Victoria, has 
approved the transfer of the guide licence.
</P>
<P>
"We would hope they would welcome it, because this isnt costing 
them anything," said Genovali. "Weve found a unique and creative 
solution, to make some progress on this issue."
</P>
<P>
"We feel that wildlife viewing and eco-tourism has so much more 
potential than sport hunting."
