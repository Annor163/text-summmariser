New measures aim to improve drug safety
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buffeted by criticism, the Food and Drug Administration said Friday
that it would appoint a director of drug safety and take other
actions to assure the safety of medications it approves.
</P>
<P>
As sick and elderly Americans competed in lotteries for scarce flu
vaccine, members of Congress chided the FDA for relying on the word
of Chiron Corp., the vaccine's manufacturer, rather than
investigating as aggressively as British regulators.
</P>
<P>
Critics also have charged the FDA ignored risks associated with
antidepressants and the blockbuster drug Vioxx, then intimidated its
own reviewers when they pointed to safety problems in both cases.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Finance Committee, one of three Congressional panels
investigating the FDA, sought from the agency Friday a year's worth
of correspondence between the agency and Merck &amp; Co. Inc.,
Vioxx's manufacturer. Investigators suspect the agency crumbled under
intense lobbying and placed cardiovascular risks less prominently on
Vioxx's label in 2002.
</P>
<P>
"The warning is in there. It's a matter of whether it's effective or
effectively buried," a committee aide said.
</P>
<P>
FDA spokeswoman Kathleen K. Quinn, provided by e-mail a copy of the
letter from Sen. Chuck Grassley, the committee chairman, declined
comment.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Steven Galson, acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research, told reporters the highly publicized
disagreements on Vioxx and antidepressants were uncommon. The
episodes don't merit tweaking the agency's culture to ensure
dissenting views are heard.
</P>
<P>
However, Dr. Eric Topol, the Cleveland Clinic cardiologist who
pointed to increased cardiovascular risks with Vioxx in 2001, said
he's spoken to at least three other FDA researchers who complained
the agency minimized their concerns about the drug.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a climate there ... of suppression of ideas and
concerns," Topol said.
</P>
<P>
Lester M. Crawford, acting FDA commissioner, said the agency's stamp
of approval means American drugs are the world's safest. "The
measures we are taking are designed to strengthen this quality as
well as our consumers' confidence that FDA's processes ensure the
highest protection of the public health," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Galson said the FDA will name a director of the Office of Drug
Safety, vacant since October 2003, to oversee the safety of drugs
after their approval.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the agency is asking the Institute of Medicine to study
whether improvements are needed to tease out more about a drug's side
effects as it comes into more widespread use. The study also will
examine whether the agency is too close to the drug industry to
regulate it effectively.
</P>
<P>
The institute is an arm of the National Academy of Science, which
advises the government on scientific matters.
</P>
<P>
Consumer advocate Sidney Wolfe said he was cynical that Crawford
would make meaningful changes, such as correcting the power imbalance
that hobbles the drug safety office and making public dissenting
reviewers' comments. "This is an attempt to put up a cosmetic fix to
a serious problem."
</P>
<P>
This week, the FDA released a Sept. 30 memo from David Graham, the
associate director for science, that said Vioxx safety concerns
continued to mount after 2000. Besides heightened cardiovascular
risks, the drug was linked to "significantly increased" risk of
hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
Also, the editor of the journal The Lancet this week pointed to
"lethal weaknesses" in FDA's regulatory oversight.
