FDA requests more safety data on Merck's successor to Vioxx
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration told Merck &amp; Co. that it
requires further safety and efficacy data before it will approve its
successor drug to now defunct pain reliever Vioxx, the pharmaceutical
maker announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts and doctors were expecting the FDA to seek additional
information before approving Arcoxia because Merck pulled Vioxx from
the market last month after a study showed it doubled patients risk
of heart attacks and strokes. The two products are in the same class
of drugs known as cox-2 inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a positive that the drug wasn't killed," Bert Hazlett,
an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
Hazlett said it is likely that the FDA will require more tests and
that Arcoxia won't hit the U.S. market for several years. He doesn't
believe the drug will begin generating significant sales until 2008.
</P>
<P>
Arcoxia is already sold in 48 countries throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to believe that Arcoxia has the potential to become a
valuable treatment option for many Americans with arthritis and pain"
chairman, president and chief executive Raymond V. Gilmartin said in
a news release.
</P>
<P>
Merck spokeswoman Anita Larson wouldn't comment beyond the company's
statement so it was unclear what would be required to achieve final
approval.
</P>
<P>
In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Merck shares rose 29
cents at $31.86. The stock had been trading above $45 before the
Vioxx recall on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Merck released positive study results for the Arcoxia
which found that there was no statistical difference in adverse
cardiovascular events between it and diclofenac, an older pain
reliever. However, the average length of time a patient was in the
trial was nine months and Vioxx's dangers didn't manifest themselves
until 18 months into the trial.
</P>
<P>
Merck is scheduled to finish a 23,500 patient study that was designed
to study cardiovascular safety in early 2006. Many analysts and
doctors believed Arcoxia would only be approved after that study is
completed and it demonstrates the drug doesn't increase the risk of
heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
The company is also conducting another study to test Arcoxia's
gastrointestinal safety profile that will also be completed in 2006.
</P>
<P>
A 7,111-patient trial was presented last week at the American College
of Rheumatology's annual meeting in San Antonio, and is part of the
Merck's application for approval. It found that dropout rates due to
stomach problems were more than double in the patients taking
diclofenac than in those taking Arcoxia.
</P>
<P>
Merck desperately needs a new hit drug to replenish its sagging
earnings. Vioxx was its second-best selling drug, accounting for 11
percent of the company's revenues last year.
</P>
<P>
The Vioxx withdrawal caused Merck's third quarter profit to fall 29
percent. Meanwhile, Merck's top seller, cholesterol medication Zocor,
loses patent protection in 2006, and analysts are not overly
enthusiastic about the company's pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed over the Vioxx withdrawal and
one analyst believes Merck could wind up paying up to $12 billion to
settle them.
