European agency to conduct review of Cox-2 arthritis drugs
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The European Medicines Agency said Friday it has been asked by the
European Commission to conduct a review of certain arthritis drugs
following the worldwide withdrawal of Merck &amp; Co.'s Vioxx
medication.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Cox-2 medicines, used to alleviate the symptoms of
rheumatoid arthritis, are already being scrutinized by the U.S.
regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, for possibly causing
cardiovascular problems in some patients.
</P>
<P>
The European agency said its review is a precautionary measure to
assess whether there is a need to make changes to marketing
authorizations. The agency, which last reviewed Cox-2 drugs in 2003,
said it would use newly available data for the latest study.
</P>
<P>
Merck withdrew its Cox-2 drug, Vioxx, from the market last month,
citing a study that found it increased the risk of heart attack and
stroke after 18 months of use. Now there are concerns that the entire
class of drugs cause similar problems
</P>
<P>
The European Medicines Agency said its review will look at all
aspects of cardiovascular safety of the Cox-2 drugs. It said possible
changes to marketing authorizations could include labeling throughout
the European Union. The review also will consider whether additional
studies are needed.
</P>
<P>
The agency did not set a date for completing the review.
