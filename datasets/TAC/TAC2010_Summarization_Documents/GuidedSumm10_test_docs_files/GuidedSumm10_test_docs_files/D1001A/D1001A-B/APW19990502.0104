	MORRISON, Colo. (AP) -- Columbine High School students and  
teachers on Sunday poured out bittersweet stories about their 
fallen friends in a final memorial service at a majestic outdoor 
amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
	The sun shined over the Red Rocks arena, whose awesome acoustics  
have drawn artists ranging from the Beatles to Pearl Jam to 
now-famous Columbine graduates Big Head Todd and the Monsters, who 
opened Sunday's memorial with a song. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd was spared the rains that have deluged the area since  
shortly after the April 20 massacre of 12 students and one teacher 
at the Littleton high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just what the doctor ordered,'' said school board  
president Jon DeStefano, at the end of the nearly two-hour service. 
``It's time to get back up on the horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He promised they will get their school back -- there had been  
talk of demolishing it and rebuilding a new facility. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the students go back to class at nearby Chatfield  
High School, their former rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not allow this tragedy to erase the 27 years of  
excellence that Columbine represents,'' principal Frank DeAngelis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also vowed the students would be safe.  
</P>
<P>
	Close friends of the 12 slain students and teacher Dave Sanders  
told stories to the 3,000 students, parents and teachers assembled 
at Red Rocks about 15 miles west of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Baumgartner said he was told to compress Rachel Scott's  
life into one minute, and then he listed all the bad things she 
never was. 
</P>
<P>
	He ended it with: ``This has been the one-minute version of  
Rachel's life. I can assure you the 17-year version was a heckuva 
lot better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Student representatives from each of the four grades sent  
get-well wishes to the 23 wounded, five of whom remained in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want you to know that we miss you guys and that we look  
forward to having you back again in school with us,'' said Tim 
Matteson, the sophomore class representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Two science teachers unfurled a banner at the front of the stage  
in honor of all Columbine students. It read ``You are OUR heroes.'' 
Two-hundred columbines were placed in front of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Student body president Heather Dinkel urged students to wear  
their T-shirts that say ``We are Columbine'' on Monday, when they 
return to class at Chatfield. 
</P>
<P>
	The memorial service opened with a song by Big Head Todd and the  
Monsters, who won Columbine's school talent show in 1984. They 
performed a song called ``Brother John,'' which included the 
lyrics: ``Children give up, don't you ever. Remember that the 
devil's clever. ... Heaven could be anywhere, why not here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	As mourners gathered at the amphitheater, others gravitated to a  
memorial near the school in Littleton. Around town, Columbine 
students got ready to go to school at their old rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go back for sure,'' said Tiffany Typher, an  
18-year-old senior wearing a ``CHS'' ribbon in her hair. But, she 
said, ``I don't want to go to Chatfield. I'd rather go back to 
Columbine, just to have closure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine is still a massive crime scene after two student  
gunmen went on a shooting and bombing spree April 20, killing 12 
students, a teacher and themselves. The school won't be reopened 
until the fall, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's nearly 2,000 students will finish out the year at  
Chatfield, three miles away. Under a school district plan, 
Chatfield students will attend classes in the morning and Columbine 
students in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Deputy Sheriff Troy Gardalen said Sunday that the  
parents of gunman Dylan Klebold were ``very cooperative'' in an 
hour-and-forty-five-minute interview with investigators. Thomas and 
Susan Klebold met with authorities Friday to answer questions about 
their 17-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of the other gunman, 18-year-old Eric Harris, have  
refused to talk with investigators unless they are granted immunity 
from criminal prosecution.
