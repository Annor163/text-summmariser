	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A 22-year-old man was formally charged  
Monday with providing a pistol to students who used it in the 
Columbine High School massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Manes, a computer programmer, said nothing during the court  
hearing in which he was charged with providing a handgun to a 
minor. 
</P>
<P>
	The felony carries a maximum six-year sentence.  
</P>
<P>
	Manes remained free on bail.  
</P>
<P>
	A former Columbine student, Manes has admitted selling the  
semiautomatic TEC DC-9 to Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, 
who used it in the lunchtime attack, killing 12 students and a 
teacher before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Robert Ransome said Manes did not know why the  
students wanted the gun and was horrified when he learned of the 
rampage.
