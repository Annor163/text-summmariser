WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Students of the Columbine High
School in Colorado State of the United States finally returned to
class Monday after two weeks of school closure due to the campus
shooting tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The students arrived at the Chatfield High School, about 4
kilometers away from the Columbine School, to continue their study
as their own school was still closed for crime investigation.
</P>
<P>
The roughly 2,000 Columbine students have not been in class
since two teenagers went on a shooting and bombing rampage on
April 20, killing 12 students and a teacher before taking their
own lives. Some 50 bombs were found in the school campus.
</P>
<P>
As the investigation into the shootings continued, Jefferson
County Sheriff John P. Stone said the man suspected of selling a
semiautomatic handgun used in the massacre could surrender Monday.
</P>
<P>
A memorial service was held Sunday at the Red Rock amphitheater
west of Denvor, capital of Colorado State, to pay tributes to the
dead in the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The campus shooting incident, which is the most serious campus
shooting in U.S. history, has shocked the whole nation and
triggered a heated debate on its causes.
</P>
<P>
American people have blamed the tragedy on the violent culture
in U.S. society and easy access to assault weapons.
