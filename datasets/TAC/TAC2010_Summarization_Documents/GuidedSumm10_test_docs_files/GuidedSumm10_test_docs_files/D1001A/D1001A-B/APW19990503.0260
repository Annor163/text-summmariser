	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Welcoming signs and banners decorated  
Chatfield High School today as students arrived from former rival 
Columbine, who hadn't been to class since the devastating shooting 
attack nearly two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For the rest of the school year, Chatfield students get their  
school for morning sessions. Columbine students, whose school is 
still a police crime scene, arrived around lunchtime today to take 
over Chatfield for afternoon classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Three large banners adorned the school today, one reading  
simply: ``Welcome Columbine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students Veronica Nuncio and Breanna Cook, both  
17-year-old juniors, showed up for their first day of classes in a 
small car with the words ``We are Columbine'' on the back window. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been really nice, very supportive,'' Cook said of the  
Chatfield students and staff. ``I didn't think they would want us 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nuncio said she was near the cafeteria when shooting broke out  
in her school, and she saw people get shot. She said she still has 
trouble sleeping, and she was nervous about going back to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel safe still,'' she said. ``I feel like I'm a  
walking target for anybody now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roughly 2,000 Columbine students haven't been in class since  
Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, went on a shooting and 
bombing rampage on April 20, killing 12 students, a teacher and 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Chatfield, about 3 miles from Columbine, was decorated to  
welcome the Columbine students, with unity signs incorporating the 
Chatfield Chargers' signature burgundy with the Columbine Rebels' 
navy blue. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can do anything to help them, we're happy to do it,''  
said Amber Mancuso, a Chatfield junior. ``I think it's hit all of 
us hard, all of us have friends there. When we found out, probably 
half the school was crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're welcoming them with open arms,'' Chatfield senior Chris  
Durant said. ``Students are trying to do what they can to make the 
Columbine students feel comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the investigation into the shootings continued, Jefferson  
County Sheriff John P. Stone said the man suspected of selling a 
semiautomatic handgun used in the massacre could surrender today. 
</P>
<P>
	The man faces a state felony charge of selling a handgun to a  
minor, the sheriff said late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis refused to elaborate on the  
timing of the arrest today. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 students, faculty and parents attended one last  
memorial Sunday at the majestic Red Rocks amphitheater west of 
Denver. Students gave touching tributes to the dead, while school 
administrators tried to ease tensions about heading back to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to get back on the horse,'' school board president  
Jon DeStefano said. ``This will take courage for all of us. But I 
promise you, you will be safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Sunday's memorial, a student representative from each of the  
four grades sent get-well wishes to the 23 wounded, five of whom 
remained in Denver hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want you to know that we miss you guys and that we look  
forward to having you back again in school with us,'' said Tim 
Matteson, the sophomore class representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, authorities appeared to move closer to concluding  
that Harris and Klebold acted alone in the attack. Detectives 
initially suspected a wider conspiracy after finding 50 bombs in 
and around Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no solid evidence to indicate there was anyone else in  
the school ... or that anybody assisted them in coming in and out 
of the school ... or transporting these items,'' District Attorney 
Dave Thomas told The Washington Post on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a sheriff's deputy said Klebold's parents were  
``very cooperative'' while being interviewed by investigators. 
Thomas and Susan Klebold met with authorities Friday to answer 
questions about their son. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris' parents have refused to talk with investigators unless  
they get immunity from criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the memorial site near Columbine, a set of 8-foot-high  
wooden crosses erected to honor the victims was taken down by the 
Illinois carpenter who put them up just last week. Greg Zanis was 
criticized for putting up crosses for the killers near those of the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	An angry father of one of the victims took down the crosses for  
Harris and Klebold, saying it wasn't appropriate to honor the 
shooters in the same spot. Later, two smaller crosses were put up 
for Harris and Klebold before Zanis arrived early Sunday and 
removed his entire display.
