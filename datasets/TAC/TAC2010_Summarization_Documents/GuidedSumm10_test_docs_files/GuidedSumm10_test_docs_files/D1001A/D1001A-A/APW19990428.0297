	ARVADA, Colo. (AP) -- Columbine High School junior Matt Wells  
took time out from the grieving world around him to crack a smile, 
chew on a wad of sunflower seeds and talk a little baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just good to be smiling and laughing,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wells, a 16-year-old catcher on Columbine's varsity baseball  
team, watched the junior varsity play Arvada West High School on 
Wednesday. There were cheers and grins here, eight days after 
teen-age gunmen walked the halls of their school and killed 12 
students and a teacher before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the gunmen had complained about their  
treatment at the hands of athletes at Columbine. When they burst 
into the library on April 20, one of the gunmen yelled: ``All jocks 
stand up! We're going to kill every one of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the massacre, the suburban school has become a sealed  
crime scene. Hundreds of backpacks and other personal belongings 
abandoned in the crisis still litter the hallways and classrooms. 
School athletic equipment is also trapped, probably for the rest of 
the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	But thanks to an outpouring of donations and support from the  
community and the sports world, Columbine's baseball team has 
uniforms, gloves, balls and everything they need to get back on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the equipment and clothing donations, the Columbine  
Rebels would have been forced to end their season, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't have played,'' he said. ``We wouldn't have been  
able to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball team has received an estimated $5,000 worth of  
clothing and gear from Reebok, Mizuno, Denver Athletic Supply and 
other sports companies. The gifts include dozens of bats, stark 
navy blue uniforms, never-used leather gloves, even socks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're taking care of us,'' coach Robin Ortiz said. ``I hate  
to say it, but it's been like Christmas at times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team members decided they wanted to play out the rest of the  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a lot of them, it's a chance to start healing,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Some players also had the chance to realize a dream. The  
Colorado Rockies opened their doors to Columbine players Monday, 
allowing the team to work out in their hitting cages and tour Coors 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies worked with the Denver Police Activities League to  
help coordinate the donations and support. League director Nick 
Arcuri said he hopes the efforts show the teens they are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was around these kids at practice the other night and some  
of them are afraid to smile,'' he said. ``They need to know that 
people out there care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The community outpouring has touched some Columbine students.  
Katie Crona, a junior varsity soccer player with the Rebels, said 
her team received new uniforms from Adidas and assistance from 
rival Arapahoe High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been so wonderful to us,'' the 14-year-old freshman  
said. ``It's so nice to know they care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some players said the donations and support will encourage them  
to play better. But Wells said he is more interested in simply 
trying to have fun and move beyond the tragedy that put his life on 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like getting back to normal life,'' he said.
