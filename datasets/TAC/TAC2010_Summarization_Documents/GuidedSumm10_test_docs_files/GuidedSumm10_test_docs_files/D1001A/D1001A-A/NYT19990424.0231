 &HT;    `Please comfort this town'

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Lynda Pasma and Kerry Herurlin stopped
halfway down Mt. Columbine on Saturday morning to pray.
</P>
<P>
   The women, both mothers of two young children, bowed their
heads, closed their eyes and whispered, ``Oh, God please bless the
families who lost children,'' and they began to cry. ``Please
comfort them and be with them,
</P>
<P>
   and comfort the people of this town. Please comfort this town.''
</P>
<P>
   Littleton needs comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning 12 Columbine High School students and a teacher
were murdered when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, also Columbine
students, opened fire with at least four guns and dozens of bombs.
The gunmen died in the massacre as well, apparently from
self-inflicted gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton needs comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Many looked for it Saturday morning on top of Mt. Columbine, a
hill in Clement Park that borders the high school's baseball
fields. The first few visitors climbed over slushy snow that melted
quickly as the sun finally made an appearance after three days of
snow.
</P>
<P>
   As the day progressed, the snow became thick mud and as many as
100 visitors at a time came to the top of the hill to look at the
rough wood cross that had been staked into the ground there. They
bent to leave flowers, poems, balloons and other mementos of grief
at the base of the cross, then stood to gaze at the familiar town
that seemed to look different after such a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Littleton is visible from the top of Mt. Columbine _ the
rows of roofs, the sidewalks, the strip malls and trash cans, the
basketball backstops above garage doors. Physically, it's the same
town it was Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But 15 of its own are gone, and the loss resonates deeply and
profoundly.
</P>
<P>
   Many wonder what to do now. How do people experiencing grief and
anger and confusion and intense sadness navigate the unfamiliar
paths to peace?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Debbie Ellwanger, a 10-year Littleton
resident. ``Nobody knows where to go from here. I think we have to
learn from this and not let those kids die in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Larry, trekked through the dirty snow up
Mt. Columbine on Saturday, fingers laced together as they cried for
the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't have died,'' Larry Ellwanger said. His wife
nodded: No, they shouldn't have died.
</P>
<P>
   So they came to the wood cross on top of Mt. Columbine to try
making sense of something that never will. Below the hill, in the
middle of the baseball field, someone had built 13 small snowmen in
an even circle. Some cannot forgive Klebold and Harris, and
possibly never will.
</P>
<P>
   On top of Mt. Columbine, though, people thought more about
healing and pulling together and getting through.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can do is come together,'' said Carrie Goertz, 16.
``It's just something that all the barriers have been broken and
people have to accept and take care of each other. There's always
going to be differences between
</P>
<P>
   people, but we've got to look past that, the exterior stuff, and
just be together, be unified.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we've got to take advantage of our time with our family
and friends,'' Aimee Jensen, 18, added quietly.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy at Columbine has brought unity that for now is
unbreakable _ it has reached around the world and drawn in the
thoughts and prayers of people far removed from suburban Colorado.
The memorials in Clement Park testify to the depth of grief that
those who didn't lose loved ones in the massacre feel.
</P>
<P>
   They bring cards and flowers, donate food and building
materials, thinking about how impossibly sad it is when people _
particularly children _ die without reason, about what they would
have done if it had happened to someone they love, about the people
suffering most.
</P>
<P>
   One card written by a boy named Mark hung on a larger memorial
sign and said: ``Dear Columbine, I hope you feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy has forced huge issues to an overburdened spotlight:
guns, youth violence, school safety, cliques and disaffected youth,
community togetherness, peace.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully they are issues that will not be forgotten when time
passes. But for now, for the next several weeks, people seem able
only to get through the worst of it, to handle the realization that
some people are not coming
</P>
<P>
   back and that yes, things like this do happen here.
</P>
<P>
   And that somehow, life keeps moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the strange things,'' said Aaron Burningham, 27,
looking out across Littleton from the top of Mt. Columbine. ``It
seems like life should stop, but it doesn't.''
