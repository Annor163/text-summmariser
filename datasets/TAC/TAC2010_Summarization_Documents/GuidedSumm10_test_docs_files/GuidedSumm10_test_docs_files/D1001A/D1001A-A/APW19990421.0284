	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The sheriff's initial estimate of as  
many as 25 dead in the Columbine High massacre was off the mark 
apparently because the six SWAT teams that swept the building 
counted some victims more than once. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff John Stone said Tuesday afternoon that there could be as  
many as 25 dead. By early Wednesday, his deputies said the death 
toll was 15, including the two gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The discrepancy occurred because the SWAT teams that picked  
their way past bombs and bodies in an effort to secure building 
covered overlapping areas, said sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were so many different SWAT teams in there, we were  
constantly getting different counts,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	As they gave periodic updates through the night, Davis and Stone  
emphasized the death toll was unconfirmed. They said their priority 
was making sure the school was safe.
