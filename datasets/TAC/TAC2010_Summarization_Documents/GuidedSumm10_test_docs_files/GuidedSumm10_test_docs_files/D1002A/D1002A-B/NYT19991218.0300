   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Al Sharpton continued to protest the
decision to transfer the trial of the four white police officers
accused of shooting Amadou Diallo to Albany, and Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela appeared with him Saturday and condemned police
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mandela appeared at a two-hour service led by Sharpton at
his headquarters in Harlem. Sharpton pledged to ``recruit an army
of righteous souls that are willing to fight no matter where.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton stood beside Diallo's father, Saikou, and accused the
state appellate court of moving the trial to Albany to ensure that
a white judge and jury would be selected. The court ruled Thursday
that prejudicial publicity had eliminated the chance of the police
officers' getting a fair trial in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton denied that protests by his followers last year had
contributed to excessive media coverage that was cited as a reason
for moving the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never marched after the indictment'' of the officers, he
said. ``We were inside with the family. We didn't march outside the
courthouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mandela, the former wife of Nelson Mandela, the
anti-apartheid hero and first black president of South Africa,
compared police brutality in New York to the oppression of black
South Africans under the system of segregation she fought to
change. She urged people to continue fighting for justice, saying
that ``in South Africa, they used the police to carry out racist,
filthy laws, but out of that was grown a progressive police
force.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Diallo also spoke against holding the trial in Albany,
saying his son had been accepted as a ``child of the Bronx.''
Diallo said he had hoped to see justice done there. ``Amadou
Diallo's life was taken brutally and now his life is going to be
diminished,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 people had signed up to go to Albany to attend the
trial as of Saturday afternoon. ``I do believe that if people do
not show up in numbers, then justice will not prevail,'' said Joyce
Oates, 55, a resident of the Soundview section of the Bronx. Ms.
Oates signed a yellow sheet of paper listing those willing to make
the trip. It was headed ``Amadou's Army.''
