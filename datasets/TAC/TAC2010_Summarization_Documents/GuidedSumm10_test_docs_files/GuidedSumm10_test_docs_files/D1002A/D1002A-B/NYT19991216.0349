<P>
   NEW YORK _ An appellate court ordered the trial of the four
officers accused of killing Amadou Diallo to be moved to Albany
County, ruling on Thursday that a fair trial would be impossible in
the Bronx because of ``the public clamor'' about the case.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member panel of the Supreme Court Appellate Division
ruled that ``this case cannot be tried in Bronx County, or anywhere
else in the City of New York, without an atmosphere in which jurors
would be under enormous pressure to reach the verdict demanded by
public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 4 shooting of Diallo outside his apartment in the Bronx
sparked large demonstrations against the police, including rallies
outside One Police Plaza that resulted in arrests of celebrities
and high-profile New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, in which 41 shots were fired, was held up as proof
by many people that police frequently react harshly in dealing with
minorities, and it has been the subject of intense news coverage.
Diallo, who was unarmed, was black and the officers who shot him
are white.
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling, the appellate court wrote: ``We conclude that
this case has been deluged by a tidal wave of prejudicial publicity
to such an extent that even an attempt to select an unbiased jury
would be fruitless.''
</P>
<P>
   The court cited several depictions of the case from media
sources, including a controversial cover on The New Yorker magazine
that showed a smiling police officer shooting at a human cut-out
bearing the words: ``41 shots, 10 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   The court noted that moving a trial in a high-profile case is
``an extraordinary remedy reserved for the rarest of cases,'' but
added that the shooting of Diallo ``is that rare case.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling was immediately denounced by prosecutors and
by Diallo's family. ``I could not disagree more strongly with the
court's decision, which cannot be appealed, to change the place of
trial of the four police officers,'' Robert T. Johnson, the Bronx
district attorney, said in a statement. ``What makes this decision
particularly disturbing is that absolutely no effort was invested
to even attempt to empanel a fair and impartial Bronx jury.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision, the statement concluded, ``reflects a lack
of trust of the jury selection process in general and of Bronx
jurors in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's parents also expressed dismay over the decision. ``We
waited all this time for justice,'' Saiku Diallo, the victim's
father, said at a press conference at the Harlem headquarters of
the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been acting as an adviser to the
family. ``It will be harmful to me and my family to travel to this
place where we've never been.''
</P>
<P>
   But Patrick Lynch, the president of Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, hailed the decision, calling it ``an opportunity for
these four officers to have a trial that is judged on the facts,
not the politics or other folks' political agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said, ``The court decision
speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The four officers _ Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss, Richard Murphy
and Edward McMellon _ are each facing two counts of second-degree
murder and one count of reckless endangerment. In a motion filed
last month, lawyers for the four men argued that the amount of
publicity the shooting has received, as well as the demonstrations
organized by Sharpton and others, had irrevocably tainted the jury
pool in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also cited the ``conventional wisdom'' that police
officers cannot get a fair trial in Bronx County, which is
populated largely by blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constitutional guarantee of the option of a jury trial is
effectively precluded to these defendants,'' said the motion, which
was written by Bennett M. Epstein, a lawyer for Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution had contended that the defense had taken media
coverage out of context and omitted accounts that were favorable to
the officers. The notion that police officers could not get a fair
trial in the Bronx was ``unfounded and unsupported,'' the
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   But the court agreed that some of the publicity was likely to
influence jurors. It cited three examples: The New Yorker cover, a
New York Post column that repeated the word ``bang'' 41 times and
an advertisement by the American Civil Liberties Union that
displayed 41 bullet holes along with the Miranda warning that
begins, ``You have the right to remain silent.'' The ad goes on to
say, ``On February 4th, 1999, the NYPD gave Amadou Diallo the right
to remain silent.''
</P>
<P>
   The five judges, all of whom were appointed by Gov. George
Pataki, said they had decided to move the trial to Albany County
because it is an urban county and is not home to large numbers of
New York City law enforcement officials. After surveying census
data on a number of counties with ``a reasonable degree of ethnic
diversity,'' the court selected Albany County.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. Census data from 1998, Albany's nearly 300,000
residents are 85.8 percent white, 9.2 percent black, 2.7 percent
Asian and 2.3 percent Hispanic. The Bronx's 1.19 million people are
48.3 Hispanic, 29.4 black, 18.6 white, and 3.7 Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers were ``dumbstruck,'' in one attorney's word, by
Thursday's decision to move the trial. ``It is a big victory, a big
victory,'' said Steven Brounstein, the lawyer for Boss. ``Now
hopefully we'll get a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers were uniformly described as pleased by the news
that the trial would go to Albany County. Stephen Worth, the lawyer
for McMellon, said that his client ``was as surprised and pleased
as we were that the Appellate Division had responded to our
argument.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Culleton, the lawyer for Murphy, said the officers
have already been so damaged by negative publicity that moving the
trial would not be much help. ``The severity of this indictment
stemmed directly from the pretrial publicity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, who led demonstrations in which former Mayor David
Dinkins, actress Susan Sarandon and more than 1,000 other people
were arrested, called the decision ``outrageous'' and
``unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a police officer in the Bronx, how come you can't be
tried in the Bronx where you have arrested people and had them
tried,'' Sharpton said, adding later, ``They cannot disenfranchise
a whole county.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``If this trial is in Alaska we'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadiadou Diallo, Diallo's mother, who said she was weak from
observing the Muslim holiday of Ramadan, was also upset by the
decision. ``We don't want our agony to be prolonged, we want
justice. This is not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial was set to begin Jan. 3, but David Bookstaver, a
spokesman for the Office of Court Administration, said it was
unclear when the trial would start. The state must pick a judge in
Albany County to hear the case, and the lawyers may request time to
find a place to live and work.
