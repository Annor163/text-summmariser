&HT;     ALBANY BRACES FOR BIG BUSINESS FROM DIALLO TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The upcoming trial of four New York City police
officers accused of killing an unarmed man won't just bring
protesters to the state capital. It also will bring money.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses, including hotels, restaurants and car rental
agencies, expect to see a spike in customers when reporters,
lawyers and protesters converge on Albany at the end of the month
for the highly charged trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, the city hopes that there will be few
protesters,'' said Anne Trimble, an owner and operator of La Serre,
an upscale restaurant downtown. ``But businesswise, it will be a
boost to the Albany economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection is scheduled to begin Jan. 31 in the trial of the
four police officers charged with killing Amadou Diallo, an unarmed
West African immigrant. The trial was moved to Albany after defense
attorneys argued that the officers could not get a fair trial in
the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, who are white, are accused of gunning down Diallo,
22, outside his Bronx home on Feb. 4, 1999, at about 12:40 a.m.
Diallo was struck by 19 of 41 shots fired at him.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as word got out the trial was headed here, the Albany
County Convention and Visitors Bureau compiled a packet promoting
hotels, restaurants and transportation services. The kit was
shipped to more than 30 media outlets in the New York City area and
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communications people will require accommodations, catering
and computer uplinks,'' said Michele Vennard, president of the
Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   New York One, an all-news cable channel in New York City, plans
to send several reporters and technicians to Albany to cover the
trial. Peter Landis, news director for New York One, expects
employees to stay for the duration of the trial, which could last a
month or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be able to go live at a moment's notice,'' Landis
said. ``As long as we think that something will be happening, there
will be no lull in our coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to tell how many protesters will converge on
the city, but pre-trial protests in the Bronx, which drew
thousands, may be a good indicator.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a room may be tough. Some hotels are already booked for
much of February by people associated with the trial. State
lawmakers also have secured rooms for the annual legislative
session.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are booked for 15 of the days in February,'' said Marc
Leffman, general manager of the Albany Crowne Plaza, the hotel
closest to the Albany County Courthouse. ``All of the other hotels
will be feeling our overflow.''
