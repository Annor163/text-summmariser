   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 18:
</P>
<P>
   The decision by a state appellate court to move the criminal
trial of four New York City police officers charged with the
killing of Amadou Diallo to Albany County seems unjustified. The
accused officers are presumed innocent and deserve a fair and
impartial trial, but there is no evidence that the people of the
Bronx and New York City cannot be trusted with this trial. Moving
the trial to Albany, a predominantly white area, could lessen the
respect with which many residents of New York City view the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, crimes are to be tried in the communities where
they are committed. The community has a legitimate interest in
observing the trial and seeing that the judicial process is open
and fair. Only in the rarest of cases have courts allowed a change
in venue on grounds that the defendants cannot get a fair trial by
an impartial jury because of prejudicial publicity.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court argued that the Diallo shooting ``is that
rare case.'' But its reasoning is inadequate. The court approved
the transfer to Albany before beginning the jury selection process.
Instead of allowing a careful voir dire process to weed out biased
jurors, the court baldly declared that even making an attempt to
find unbiased jurors would be ``fruitless.'' It is simply not
credible that there are not a dozen people in the Bronx who have
the fairness and courage to resist community pressures to render a
verdict based on the evidence, when no effort has been made to test
the prospective jury pool.
</P>
<P>
   The court based its ruling on what it calls a ``tidal wave of
prejudicial publicity.'' It cited a New Yorker magazine cover
showing a police officer firing at a cutout target in human shape
at a carnival shooting gallery, a column in The New York Post, and
a newspaper ad by the American Civil Liberties Union that showed 41
bullet holes for the 41 shots fired at Diallo. The court fails to
mention the large quantity of balanced press coverage about the
defendants, their job records and various scenarios that might
explain the shooting. The court also pointed to demonstrations
after the shooting and public opinion polls as indicative of a
prejudicial atmosphere. But those do not bear on whether impartial
jurors can be found in the Bronx who can do their duty as required
by law.
</P>
<P>
   Many highly publicized, politically charged cases _ from the
trial of the officers charged with attacking Abner Louima to the
World Trade Center bombing _ were not transferred to other venues.
Even if the court was worried that passions are too high in the
borough where the shooting occurred, the choice of Albany, a
community that does not in any way resemble the Bronx, is
inappropriate. The court could have moved the trial to Manhattan,
Queens or Brooklyn, where surely 12 fair-minded jurors could have
been found. By moving the trial without making any effort to find
unbiased jurors in the Bronx, the court may heighten suspicions in
minority communities about the fairness of the criminal justice
system.
