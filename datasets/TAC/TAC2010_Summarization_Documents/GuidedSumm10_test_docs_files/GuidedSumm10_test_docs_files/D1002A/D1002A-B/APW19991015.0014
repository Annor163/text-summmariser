<HEADLINE> NYC Cop Discusses Diallo Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four police officers shot and killed an unarmed  
African immigrant after he ran from them, refused their orders to 
stop, and then reached into his pocket, one of the officers said in 
a magazine interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Carroll made his remarks in the November issue of  
``American Police Beat,'' made available to reporters on Friday. 
It's the first time any of the officers have spoken publicly since 
they fired 41 bullets at Amadou Diallo on Feb. 4 while he stood 
outside his Bronx home. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting led to daily civil disobedience demonstrations and  
inspired a painful examination of police attitudes and tactics 
across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers' attorneys have said their clients fired at Diallo  
because they thought he had a gun. In the article, Carroll said 
Diallo matched the description of a rape suspect they were looking 
for and they called for him to stop. But Diallo started running and 
the officers pursued him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stop, police. Stop, police,'' they yelled, according to  
Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Once outside his Bronx apartment building, Diallo turned around  
and reached into his pocket, Carroll said, and that's when they 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll said his family has received death threats since the  
shooting, and protesters have marched on his home on Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the officers were indicted earlier this year on  
second-degree murder charges and are awaiting trial.
