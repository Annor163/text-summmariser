   NEW YORK _ The four New York City police officers charged with
murdering Amadou Diallo returned to work with pay Friday after
attending a morning court session in the Bronx in which a Jan. 3
trial date was set.
</P>
<P>
   They left the courtroom to the cheers of nearly 200 other
officers, gathered outside the Bronx County Building.
</P>
<P>
   But inside state Supreme Court, the defense team showed signs of
division.
</P>
<P>
   Marvyn M. Kornberg, the lawyer for Sean Carroll, said he might
make a motion to disqualify Stephen C. Worth, the lawyer for Edward
McMellon. Kornberg said Worth, who had represented all of the
officers immediately after the shooting, might have a conflict of
interest now since he was representing only one of them and might
be forced to cross-examine the others.
</P>
<P>
   It was a point that Worth disputed outside court by saying, ``I
don't think I have a conflict of interest, though it is obvious
that Kornberg would like for me to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials declined to say where the officers _ Kenneth
Boss, Richard Murphy, Carroll and McMellon _ would be working,
adding only that they were on modified duty and carrying no guns or
badges.
</P>
<P>
   Worth said that the officers reported to their new assignments
Friday but would not officially start work until Monday, on what
police officials called administrative assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, acting Justice Patricia Anne Williams, who refused
defense requests to put off scheduling a date for the case, chose
the Jan. 3 date after the defense lawyers said they would need time
to go through the prosecution's evidence and discuss possible
pretrial motions.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also said there could be pretrial scheduling
conflicts because of other trials some of them are involved in,
like the Abner Louima case, in which officers are accused of
brutalizing a Haitian immigrant. That case is set to begin on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors turned over more than 160 pages of forensic,
ballistic and crime scene evidence to the defense lawyers, adding
that more would be forthcoming. The judge said the next court
appearance would be on Sept. 29, when she would decide all motions.
</P>
<P>
   While the trial date would come nearly a year after Diallo's
death on the night of Feb. 4, it is not unusual in such
high-publicity cases. Defense lawyers are usually pleased by delays
to the extent that they can temper bad publicity about the case,
which they see as possibly prejudicial to their clients.
</P>
<P>
   But if the delay was welcome, there were still Kornberg's
efforts to force Worth, the official lawyer for the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association, off the case. Kornberg said later that if
Worth was not disqualified, Kornberg might push for a separate
trial for Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of severing the cases is important because the
defendants will probably need one another's testimony to
corroborate their accounts of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the defense has suggested that the 41 shots fired
at Diallo _ a number that has become a flash point in the case _
were precipitated by one of the officers yelling ``Gun!'' and
another falling down some steps as if he had been shot.
