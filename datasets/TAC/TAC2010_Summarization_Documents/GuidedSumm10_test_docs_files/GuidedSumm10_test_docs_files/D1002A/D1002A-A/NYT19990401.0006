 NEW YORK: for guns.

<P>
   The arraignment and the subsequent comments by the officers'
lawyers offered a glimpse of the defense they will provide.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Brounstein, the lawyer for Boss, and James Culleton, the
lawyer for Murphy, both said that their clients heard gunfire and
saw McMellon on the ground, leading them to assume that McMellon
had been shot.

   After the arraignment, Kornberg said his client, Carroll, had
seen a ``black object'' _ which turned out to be Diallo's wallet _
coming out of the victim's back pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client saw him reaching into his back pocket, saw this
black object come out and my client yelled `Gun!''' Kornberg said.
</P>
<P>
   After the court proceedings, the officers briefly thanked their
supporters, and proclaimed their innocence. Eyes welling, brows
knitted, Murphy said, ``I did nothing wrong and this trial will
show that I did nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Diallos, who met with Johnson for half an hour before
the arraignment, and their supporters expressed satisfaction with
the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice for everyone
in this life,'' said Diallo's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, at a news
conference after the arraignment at the Manhattan law offices of
Johnny Cochran, who said he would prepare a civil suit on behalf of
the Diallo family.

   Police officers have rarely been convicted for killings that
occurred while they were on duty. The last such case was in July
1997, when Officer Paolo Colecchia was convicted of second-degree
manslaughter for fatally shooting an unarmed man in the back as he
fled down a Bronx subway platform.
