   NEW YORK _ Some of the police officers who shot and killed
Amadou Diallo have told associates that their attention was
initially drawn to Diallo when they saw him standing on the stoop
of a Bronx apartment building and thought they saw him peering into
the window of a first-floor apartment, according to people with
knowledge of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Those officers told associates that they grew more suspicious
when two of them got out of their car to question him and he
retreated into the vestibule of the building, the people
knowledgeable about the case said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers, who are scheduled to be arraigned on criminal
charges in state Supreme Court in the Bronx on Wednesday, did not
testify about the shooting before the grand jury that heard their
case. Diallo, an unarmed man with no criminal history, was killed
on Feb. 4 when the four officers fired 41 shots at him, 19 of which
hit him.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting led to 15 days of protests outside Police
Headquarters and reignited the gnawing debate about police in New
York City. During the outcry the officers, their lawyers and
law-enforcement officials have remained silent about what set off
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But several officers are said to have told associates that the
chain of events that led to the fatal shooting of Diallo began when
the officers first spotted him and thought that they saw him
looking into the window.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers _ Edward McMellon, Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss
and Richard Murphy, all in plain clothes _ were driving along
Wheeler Avenue in the Soundview section of the Bronx at 12:40 a.m.
when they first spotted Diallo pacing on the stoop of No. 1157. The
officers did not know it, but it was the building where he lived.
</P>
<P>
   McMellon and Carroll got out of their maroon Ford Taurus and
approached Diallo on the stoop. McMellon stood to the left and
Carroll to the right as they mounted the steps.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next is sure to be the subject of much debate at
the future criminal trial of the four officers. The four police
officers have yet to officially explain their actions. But several
officers told associates that after the officers identified
themselves and asked to talk to Diallo, he retreated into the
building's vestibule and appeared to be trying to reach the inner
door, the people with knowledge of the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo remained silent during the whole encounter, they said.
</P>
<P>
   According to this account, several officers told associates that
while Diallo was in the vestibule, he made a move that led them to
believe he was armed: he turned to his right, reached into his
pocket and pulled something out. It turned out later to be his
black wallet.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Carroll yelled, ``Gun!'' the people knowledgeable
about the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the details were first reported Tuesday in The New York
Post.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear from Tuesday's accounts who fired the first shot.
</P>
<P>
   As the first gunshots rang out, McMellon fell backwards down the
steps and injured his tailbone, causing at least some of his
colleagues to believe that he had been hit by return fire, people
knowledgeable about the case said. Carroll moved to his right and
continued firing, and Murphy and Boss, who were closer to the car,
began firing as well, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the officers are said to have told associates that
they continued firing because Diallo did not fall even after they
had unleashed the fusillade. When the officers saw afterward that
Diallo was unarmed, the people knowledgeable about the case said,
at least one of the officers wept.
