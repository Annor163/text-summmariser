   LOS ANGELES _ For the last two years, Mari Frank has spent more
than 500 hours and $10,000 to clear her name because a Ventura,
Calif., woman assumed her identity, stole her credit record and
racked up debt along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got a red convertible Mustang in my name. ... I think
she's still driving it,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Frank was the victim of the fastest-growing
crime in America: identity theft.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Friday, California will become only the ninth state
to prosecute identity theft as a felony. The new law is the latest
in a series of recent local and federal guidelines set up to
protect Americans from the misappropriation of a name, Social
Security number, driver's license or any other form of
identification for monetary gain.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service estimates that identity theft cost U.S.
citizens $750 million last year, up from $450 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Identity theft is the fastest-growing crime in America, maybe
even the world,'' Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti
said at a news conference Wednesday to explain the new law.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties will include prison sentences of up to three years and
fines up to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Until a year ago, there was no legal punishment in California
for identity theft. In January, it became a misdemeanor,
infrequently prosecuted by most district attorneys' offices in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a new civil law became effective, forcing credit
agencies to clear the records of identity-theft victims who can
present a police report documenting the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said the law will give his prosecutors the ammunition
they need to fight identity theft.
</P>
<P>
   Identity theft also became a federal felony this year,
punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said increased use of computers, along with the ease
of getting a credit card by mail, is responsible for the rise in
identity crimes. But an identity thief doesn't need to be a master
hacker to get sensitive information.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, who suggests people shred discarded mail, said some
criminals find personal identity information in a trash bin.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said her alter ego, who was prosecuted under credit card
fraud laws and sentenced to a work furlough program, got the credit
information from a computer database that private investigators
use. Within a few months, the identity thief had obtained checks, a
driver's license and even business cards in Frank's name.
</P>
<P>
   After Frank found out about the crime, the Laguna Niguel,
Calif., lawyer spent hundreds of hours talking on the phone and
writing letters before her record was clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the true, real Mari Frank and it was not very easy to
prove that,'' she said. &QL;
