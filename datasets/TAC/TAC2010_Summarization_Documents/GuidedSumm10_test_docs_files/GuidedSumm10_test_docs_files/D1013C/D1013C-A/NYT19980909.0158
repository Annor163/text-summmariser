<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ John Santner likes to collect names.
</P>
<P>
   He had 160 them when the police arrested him last October,
including Florida driver's licenses with his picture under more
than a dozen different names, none of them his own. Most of the
identification cards listed people whose names were ``borrowed'' to
commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The licenses helped Santner and five accomplices scam at least
$4 million from businesses and mess up the lives of many innocent
people with forged checks and fraudulent credit cards. The police
said Santner had masterminded the biggest identity theft scam ever
seen in San Francisco, with a ring of thieves who took names and
Social Security numbers of other people and then created fraudulent
paper trails.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are artists,'' said San Francisco Police Inspector
Earl Wismer.
</P>
<P>
   Santner is a chilling example of one of the fastest-growing
crimes in the world. Identity theft accounts for about half of the
$1.5 billion in credit card theft in 1995, according to the Secret
Service, which monitors the crime. Consumer advocates estimate that
up to 350,000 people are victimized each year.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Santner, 33, pleaded guilty to nine counts of fraud and
was sentenced to six years in prison. His partner in crime,
29-year-old Eric Shay, received a six-year sentence after pleading
guilty to 18 fraud counts. Four co-defendants are at large or
awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Identity theft is a crime that evolves with every advance in
technology. For the complex international economy to function
efficiently, credit must be easy, and money must move quickly and
electronically. A skilled thief can take advantage of that system,
harvest names, purchase thousands of dollars of merchandise and
bill it all to an unwitting victim whose identity has been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Credit card theft had been the realm of pickpockets for decades.
Now, a new breed of high-tech thieves can steal a whole identity
and run up charges in the name, sometimes for years, without the
victim's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   A national credit bureau, Trans Union Corp., has seen the number
of consumer inquiries and reports to its Fraud Victim Assistance
Department jump from 35,235 in 1992 to 522,922 in 1997, according
to figures cited by the General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Identity theft is a plague right now,'' said Beth Givens of
the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse in San Diego, which tracks the
problem nationally. ``Every day, charges are being credited to
people who have no idea what's really going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Givens and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private
consumer advocacy organization, estimate that up to 350,000 people
are victimized by identity theft each year.
</P>
<P>
   Most identity fraud starts small, with a few forged checks or
purchases on a stolen credit card. The more complicated scheme is
total identity assumption, where a thief applies for credit cards,
loans, utility accounts and apartments under someone else's name.
In some cases, a criminal will electronically graft his or her
photo onto a legally valid driver's license under another person's
name with correct information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same people in yesteryear who may have gone guns blazing
into a bank are now doing identity theft,'' said Alison Koch, an
investigator with the California Department of Motor Vehicles who
specializes in identification fraud. ``It's a lot safer to do this
with a computer. ... Once they steal an ID, they can use false
documents to commit a multitude of white-collar crimes. And it's
difficult to catch people.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, one identification card will be used to apply for
instant credit at as many as a dozen department stores in a week.
The thief can walk in, get credit with the bogus ID and leave with
thousands of dollars in computer equipment, stereo components or
jewelry. Often, they'll hit different stores in different cities in
the course of a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They move fast to stay ahead of local law enforcement,'' said
Inspector Phil Dito, who worked the Santner case.
</P>
<P>
   The police broke the Santner ring because its leader liked San
Francisco too much, said Wismer, who spent more than two years
pursuing its leader. Santner stayed in the city for two years, even
after coming to the attention of investigators in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Santner and Shay participated in nearly every form of identity
theft, the police said. Few scam artists are as sophisticated as
Santner, a former chef with a knack for computers, and Shay, a
former employee of the credit reporting agency TRW (now known as
Experian) who is familiar with consumer databases.
</P>
<P>
   ``They mastered every aspect of this crime,'' Wismer said. ``It
was just like a business. They kept very detailed records. It was
an efficient, well-run criminal enterprise.''

</P>
<P>
   They used an unusual combination of high-tech and low-tech
methods to commit their crimes. Sophisticated computer graphic let
the duo create bogus driver's licenses from other states. They
searched Internet databases for personal information on potential
victims.
</P>
<P>
   But they found much of their treasure in the trash can. They
sifted through garbage for credit card receipts and paycheck stubs.
They broke into mailboxes on the street and in apartment complexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made master keys to many of the mailboxes in San
Francisco ...'' Wismer said. ``They even had a postal uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   The police believe the thieves' favorite pieces of mail were
preapproved credit applications, charge card bills, car insurance
bills and motor vehicle registration notices, all used as building
blocks for false paper trails.
</P>
<P>
   Santner and his accomplices applied for credit cards and loans
and set up checking accounts. They put together folders on all
their potential victims, including one containing a department
store account statement and a garbage bill belonging to Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif. They had another file under the name of a
prosecutor who worked their case.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the suspects had stolen ID cards and checks,
altered them with state-of-the-art desktop publishing equipment and
reprinted the bogus cards on a color printer. They were able to
electronically scan driver's licenses and then change the
information and drop in their own photographs, Wismer said.
</P>
<P>
   When the police raided Santner's office last October, officers
found extensive records on potential targets along with computers,
scanners and a huge amount of equipment. There was a mountain of
confidential data, including information poached from voter rolls,
credit applications and a master list of thousands of Florida
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of these names may not have been used _ yet _ but they
were always looking for new victims,'' Wismer said.
