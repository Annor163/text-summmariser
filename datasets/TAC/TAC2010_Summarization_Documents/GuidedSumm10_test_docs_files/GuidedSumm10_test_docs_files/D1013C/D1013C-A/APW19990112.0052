<HEADLINE> Audit: IRS System a Privacy Threat </HEADLINE>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although the IRS is making some progress, a  
new audit says chronic computer system weaknesses continue to place 
sensitive taxpayer data at risk of theft, fraud and even misuse by 
hackers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They still have a long way to go,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson,  
R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personal information on IRS computers is at risk to  
unauthorized disclosure, destruction or modification, and most 
alarmingly, to identity theft,'' Thompson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit by the congressional General Accounting Office of six  
IRS facilities, also found that 397 computer tapes containing 
taxpayer information had been lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO credited the Internal Revenue Service with making some  
major leaps forward in improving computer security since another 
critical audit in April 1997. The IRS says it has corrected 75 
percent of the problems identified in that report. 
</P>
<P>
	But the GAO said ``serious weaknesses'' remain. Among them:  
</P>
<P>
	--Computer hackers could access IRS data with relative ease  
because information isn't encrypted before it is transmitted over 
telephone lines. IRS says it has no evidence such a crime has 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	--Too many IRS employees have access to sensitive computing  
areas, raising the possibility of information theft. 
</P>
<P>
	--Employees without a need to know have the ability to change or  
delete taxpayer information. Some tapes and disks are not 
overwritten before being used again, allowing unauthorized access 
to some of this information, including Social Security numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	--The new IRS system aimed at catching employees who illegally  
``browse'' through taxpayer files is working on only one of several 
computer systems, and it cannot detect which activities are 
legitimate and which are not. 
</P>
<P>
	--Few contingency plans are in place in case of disaster, such as  
an alternative computer processing site or effective backup 
electric generators. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written response, IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said he  
agreed with many of the conclusions and GAO recommendations, but he 
insisted that the agency is well on the way to a more complete 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti, whose background in the private sector focused on  
information systems, said the initial focus has been on larger data 
processing systems and it is now moving into other areas. But he 
noted that making these changes at the agency's more than 1,000 
facilities ``cannot be completed in a few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new centralized IRS systems office completed a review of what  
needed to be done at all district offices in December and has now 
begun examining all other offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that managing risk and prioritizing corrective  
actions and resources is the key to making needed and measurable 
improvements,'' Rossotti said in his response. ``Protecting 
taxpayer information and the systems used to deliver services to 
taxpayers are key to the success of a customer-focused IRS.''
