   LOS ANGELES _ Sandy Darby is furious.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a couple masquerading as her company's business
associates passed phony corporate checks with her husband's forged
signature in laser printing. The thieves' take at two major retail
stores: $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, a man tried to cash more than $600 in fake checks
at a cash-checking business. The checks bore her company's name and
even sported a counterfeit Bank of America logo, sans address.
</P>
<P>
   A check-cashing business approved a $500 check, which her bank
cashed. An employee at another check-cashing business got
suspicious and telephoned Darby. But before the police could be
called, the suspect left.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is killing me,'' said Darby, the owner of a family-run
tour business with five employees in suburban Northridge. ``I'm a
small business.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for her, Darby won't have to pay the money lost on the
forged checks. The bank and retail stores will be paying for it.
But she must deal with the headache of clearing up credit reports
and changing the account number.
</P>
<P>
   Darby is among thousands of Americans confronted with identity
thefts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Identity thefts are overwhelming credit bureaus, postal
inspectors and the Secret Service,'' said Ed Mierzwinski, speaking
on behalf of the California Public Interest Group. ``We think the
trend is up, up, up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to estimate the actual size of losses incurred by
banks and businesses that grant credit, but estimates run up to $4
billion a year, said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights
Clearinghouse, a consumer information and advocacy group in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report by the U.S. General Accounting
Office, the Secret Service estimates that $750 million was lost
last year from identity theft, up from $450 million in 1996. Credit
reporting companies received 523,000 fraud inquiries in 1997, up
from 35,000 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: It's so easy to obtain personal
information.
</P>
<P>
   For example, people can steal preapproved credit card
solicitations in the mail, dive behind dumpsters of office
buildings to get corporate documents, or access family Web pages on
the Internet to get personal data.
</P>
<P>
   Givens said one woman was victimized because her health
insurance company uses her Social Security number as her member
identification. Authorities believe that an employee of the
insurance company stole her Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   While consumers usually aren't charged for the fraud, it does
tangle up their credit records, Givens said. It takes from six
months to several years to fix the record, depending on the
severity of the problem, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Check fraud is one of the banking industry's biggest problems,
costing banks about $1 billion a year, said Sonia Barbara, a
spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But a new law signed by the president last week should help
consumers and business victims. The Identity Theft and Assumption
Deterrence Act of 1998 makes it a felony to commit identity theft.
While it already is a crime to impersonate someone else for fraud,
this law specifically focuses on ID theft.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the American Bankers Association launched a radio
campaign to warn seniors about this crime.
</P>
<P>
   The group's warning: Be careful about giving out personal
information such as Social Security numbers and bank account
numbers. Carefully monitor your bank and credit-card accounts to
spot any activity that wasn't yours, and contact the bank right
away if you find any.
</P>
<P>
   You also can have your credit report blocked, to be released
only when you call in with your personal identification number,
Mierzwinski said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who think they might be victims should contact the
nation's main credit bureaus right away: Transunion (800) 680-7289,
Equifax (800) 525-6285, and Experian, formerly TRW (888) 397-3742.
</P>
<P>
   To be taken off the mailing list for preapproved credit cards,
call (888) 5-OPT-OUT.
