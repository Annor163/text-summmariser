 &HT;    Identity theft crimes drive shredder sales

   ATLANTA _ Add this to the list of American family values,
somewhere after the kids, the mortgage and the family pet:
</P>
<P>
   The family paper shredder.
</P>
<P>
   On a Monday afternoon at Office Depot in Atlanta's Lindbergh
Plaza, Dana Harrison, 36, is trying to decide which model to buy.
She scans an assortment of shredders, from the simple $24.99
Fellowes Shredstik to the $199.99 Fellowes PS75 that destroys
staples and paper clips, as well as paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a victim of identity theft,'' she says. ``But,
it seems like not too much to spend for peace of mind. I used to
just tear my bank statements into pieces. This seems safer.''
</P>
<P>
   She buys the Shredstik, joining a burgeoning group of American
shedder-users.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 9 million shredders were sold in America last year.
That's up from about 100,000 at the beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in sales of shredders _ a piece of equipment once
mainly associated with covert government operations _ is attributed
to the increased number of people with home offices, and fear of
``identity theft.''
</P>
<P>
   Thieves take important personal numbers, including date of birth
and Social Security numbers, and other financial information tossed
into the trash, and use it to defraud banks and credit card
companies _ in the victim's name.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an unreasonable fear, says Beth Givens, head of the San
Diego-based nonprofit organization Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Identity theft isn't new,'' says Givens. ``But in the last
five years it has exploded, and there are a lot of reasons why.
It's lucrative, and because it's a nonviolent crime, even if the
criminals are caught, they get light sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Predicts Givens: ``The day is going to come when home shredders
are as common as the microwave.''
</P>
<P>
   Office product makers and retailers are doing their part to
fulfill that prophecy. For three months this year Office Depot
pitched shredders on Atlanta TV. The spot showed an older couple on
a sailboat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam and Margaret are living a comfortable retirement,'' said
the announcer, ``and it's all because you left your credit card
statement in the garbage and they stole your name.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Sam Ambrose, manager of advertising communications
for Office Depot, the shredder market is still virtually untapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 1 percent of homes own one,'' he says. ``And there are 94
million households in America.''
