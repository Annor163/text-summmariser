<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``You're kidding!'' my wife exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   I had just told her that someone had gained access to our
private bank records, lifted our account number and recorded our
balance.
</P>
<P>
   She listened in stunned silence. There was more.
</P>
<P>
   They had also tracked our recent long-distance calls,
identifying those we had telephoned by name, address and
occupation. And they had compiled dossiers on us, complete with
Social Security numbers, property holdings and financial dealings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's incredible,'' she said. ``How can they do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Easily, it turns out, in the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   ``They,'' I finally confessed, was actually my Cox Newspapers
Washington Bureau colleague Elliot Jaspin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning
high-tech wizard who had delved into our personal lives at my
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   He was trying to come up with a way for our reporters to use
computer databases to do background checks on little-known figures
who suddenly break into the news, quickly learning about pending
lawsuits or long-concealed arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Start with only my name, I suggested, and see what you can get.
</P>
<P>
   He hit pay dirt within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Given more time _ and a little money _ he soon would have been
able to obtain confidential records of my credit card purchases,
salary, stocks, bonds, credit history, life insurance policy,
recent air travel, whether I had ever been nailed for speeding, and
even my medical records going back 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   While the popular notion is that a computer linked to the
Internet is a key that unlocks all kinds of personal secrets, most
databases on the Internet are dull as dishwater.
</P>
<P>
   Switchboard (http://www.switchboard.com), for example, will
allow you to instantly discover Uncle Edgar's telephone number in
Dubuque. But then, calling Dubuque information will get you the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, however, carries ads for a burgeoning and largely
uncontrolled industry of ``information brokers'' that _ for a fee _
will reveal the most intimate details of your life, right down to
that birthmark on your backside or ancient records of psychological
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   For fees as low as $1.50 a minute or $40 per search, they will
disclose non-published telephone numbers or track down the owners
of private aircraft. Corporate Investigative Services of
Huntsville, Ala., has a Web site
(http://www.hsv.tis.net/(tilde)pvteye/source.html) that also allows
you to listen to the theme music from ``Mission Impossible'' while
you link to hundreds of other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, like AutoTrack, have assembled massive
computerized databases containing several billion public records.
Using sophisticated database software, information is quickly
plucked from scores of different files, and within minutes is woven
together into a report.
</P>
<P>
   It was through such a company that Jaspin unearthed a loan I
took out in North Carolina and the tax records on property I own in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   AutoTrack files are interesting, but not nearly as revealing as
companies that use what they politely term ``pretexts'' to shoehorn
information from banks, phone companies, and whomever else you may
do business with. The major weapon here is a huckster's patter
rather than a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from information broker ads, everything is up for grabs.
That includes such sensitive financial information as the location
of your safe deposit box, your bank deposits anywhere in the world,
and even your bank account history, including dates and amounts of
deposits, checks written or wire transfers.
</P>
<P>
   As privacy expert Robert Ellis Smith of Rhode Island noted,
``Every fact about you is on record somewhere,'' and information
brokers see that as fair game. Posing as a forgetful husband,
telephone repairman, or bank clerk, a private investigator can
often get this information by outwitting low-level clerks at the
phone company or some obscure branch of a major bank.
</P>
<P>
   There are few laws forbidding disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our company policy not to release any customer
information without a court order or some legal document,'' said
Sandy Arnette, a spokeswoman for Bell Atlantic in Baltimore. ``But
there is no state or federal law against disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the House Banking Committee found only three states _
Connecticut, Illinois and Maine _ with laws making it a crime to
induce an employee of a financial institution to disclose data
about a customer's account. And there are no federal statutes
against using ``pretexts'' to wangle private data from financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James A. Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, tried unsuccessfully to get the practice outlawed last
year, and he has introduced the same bill again this year.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares if you have a checking account in Duluth and own
40 acres of scrub land in Texas?
</P>
<P>
   Creditors do.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, who need to collect on bad credit card debts, routinely
turn to lawyers who specialize in collections. And these lawyers,
in turn, use information brokers to find assets they can attach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of credit card collection. Thousands of cases a
week,'' said Mike Martin of Advanced Research, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bankers Association supports Leach's proposed
legislation to outlaw fraudulently obtaining information from
banks. But at the same time, Martin noted, ABA member banks ``hire
us to do exactly what it is they're trying to shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   Information brokers will also chase deadbeat dads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often, it gets used for good purposes,'' said private
investigator Edmund Pankau of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not long ago,'' he recalled, his firm traced the financial
dealings of a Houston man who had left his family. The information
allowed them to locate the man in another city. ``He had skipped
out on his ex-wife,'' Pankau said, ``but they needed to find him
because his daughter needed a bone marrow transplant and he was the
only one who could help.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the press also use information brokers to snoop. Al
Schweitzer, a controversial private investigator _ he pleaded
guilty in 1992 to illegally buying Social Security records _ became
a legend by compiling detailed dossiers on Hollywood stars for the
National Enquirer.
</P>
<P>
   After actor Kiefer Sutherland split from Julia Roberts,
Schweitzer used her phone records to locate him at his ranch in
Whitefish, Mont. He used the same method to track down Marlon
Brando's daughter in Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   In cases like these, no one lost anything more than privacy, and
probably some sleepless nights worrying that Schweitzer was
constantly on the prowl. But there is a darker side.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials express growing concern about ``identity
fraud'' or ``identity theft,'' in which a con artist uses purloined
personal financial information to assume your identity, then loots
your bank account or makes costly purchases with your credit card
number.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which Americans are actually harmed by this is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   A report last year by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, suggests a startling rise in
identity fraud. Trans Union, a leading credit reporting firm, told
GAO that the number of inquiries about credit fraud it receives
each year jumped from 35,235 in 1992 to 522,922 in 1997. Two-thirds
involved identity fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But in the same report, GAO acknowledged that it could find ``no
comprehensive statistics on the prevalence of identity fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressured by the Federal Trade Commission and the threat of
restrictive legislation, some large data collection firms have
begun self-regulation. Several such companies represented by the
Individual Reference Services Group recently agreed to abide by
rules limiting unauthorized disclosure of information.
</P>
<P>
   But hundreds of other firms remain essentially unregulated,
including the bulk of information brokers.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, only a handful existed. Today, said Evan
Hendricks, editor of the Washington-based Privacy Times newsletter,
there may be as many as 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of the Internet and higher-powered computers means
we've entered an era where ``nothing is private,'' warned Pankau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything that's private,'' agreed Smith, who
publishes Privacy Journal, a monthly newsletter that monitors how
new technology affects privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But the extent of actual financial harm is difficult to gauge.
</P>
<P>
   My wife later acknowledged that she was most troubled by the
notion that someone could so easily obtain information we thought
was private. Disclosure, she conceded, does not automatically mean
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would argue that just the mere unauthorized access (to
private information) is one form of harm,'' Hendricks said, ``and
psychological harm is very real.''
