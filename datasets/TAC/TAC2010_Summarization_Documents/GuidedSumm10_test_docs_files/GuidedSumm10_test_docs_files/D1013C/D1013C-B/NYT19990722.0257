   WASHINGTON _ The ability of suspected serial killer Angel
Maturino Resendiz to avoid capture with phony identification cards
illustrates the need for a more secure Social Security document, a
U.S. congressman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, all U.S. citizens are vulnerable to identity theft
because our basic identity documents, such as driver's licenses and
Social Security cards, are so easy to forge and because no adequate
verification mechanisms are in place,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith,
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's immigration panel.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, R-Texas, said steps must be taken in the United States
``to protect our identity documents from fraud and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   One civil rights group advised Congress to avoid creating a
``national ID card'' that could infringe on the privacy of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, who surrendered to a Texas Ranger on July 13
in El Paso, used forged or stolen documents to elude law
enforcement officials in several states. He was indicted in Houston
Thursday in connection with the December slaying of a physician.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, 39, has either been charged with or linked to
at least eight other slayings in Kentucky, Illinois and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   During a congressional oversight hearing, Smith said Maturino
Resendiz:
</P>
<P>
   _ Used a fraudulent driver's license in Vermont in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bought or stole a voter registration card in 1987 from a
homeless man in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Had three Social Security cards and a false U.S. passport when
arrested in 1988 by Immigration and Naturalization Service
officers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Possessed a forged Social Security card when arrested for
trespassing on railroad property in Pulaski County, Ky., in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than a decade, Congress has been trying to address
the vulnerabilities in the documents that (he) was able to
exploit,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the Clinton administration for failing to implement
parts of immigration bills in 1990 and 1996 to curb fraud and abuse
of documents.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Department of Health and Human Services have
said part of the problem lies with the lack of set standards used
by states to issue birth certificates.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration, meanwhile, has estimated it
would cost the government as much as $9.2 billion to issue
counterfeit-resistant Social Security cards to 277 million eligible
cardholders.
</P>
<P>
   And states oppose federal efforts to print Social Security
numbers on a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driver's license is an authorizing document for driving
motorized vehicles, not a document intended to be used as an
identifier of U.S. citizenship,'' said state Rep. Brian Flaherty,
R-Conn., a vice chairman for federal issues with the National
Conference of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, U.S. lawmakers are considering measures that would
make it more difficult for illegal immigrants from cobbling
together identification cards to obtain legal status falsely. Those
measures also are aimed at protecting Americans from theft and
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Nojeim, legislative counsel with the American Civil
Liberties Union, warned that lawmakers are creeping toward a
national identity card, which he called ``one of the greatest
threats to personal privacy in the United States today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If mandated by Congress for one purpose, we know from
experience that a national ID card would eventually be required for
engaging in even the most routine transactions, from opening a bank
account to boarding an airplane to entering a building,'' Nojeim
said.
