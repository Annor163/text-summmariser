<HEADLINE> Senate GOP unveils privacy protection recommendations  </HEADLINE>

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The stockpile of public information is as
potentially frightening as it is extensive: professors display test
results by social security numbers, the long and revealing trail of
E-Z pass tags, and prisoners -- at least in other states -- uncover
personal information of innocent citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Following 13 months of research and testimony, Senate
Republicans on Wednesday introduced a 78-page report of
recommendations to ''prevent the state from becoming a culprit'' in
the national problem of privacy invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ''You name it and there's a problem,'' said Senate Majority
Leader Joseph Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican. ''Educational
records, medical records, insurance, banking, Department of Motor
Vehicles, with your licenses; E-Z Pass, supermarket scanners, you
name it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno was joined by Senate Republicans who have already or say
they are about to submit proposals to crack down on identity theft
and the ''wild west mentality'' of credit card companies, marketing
firms, and even the government.
</P>
<P>
   The report was produced by a task force chaired by Bruno, with
Sen. Michael Nozzolio, a Finger Lakes Republican.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Nozzolio evoked the case of Cynthia Watkins, a
retired elementary school teacher from his district, who learned
her identity had been stolen when an armed bounty hunter burst into
her home and demanded to know where she and her husband were hiding
the BMW.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should insure that victims of the fastest growing crime in
America, identity theft, have protections,'' Nozzolio said.
</P>
<P>
   Task force research found that inmates in some states working on
government contracts involving telephone contact have used social
security numbers to access credit card numbers and other
information to commit fraud and harass customers.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bruno spokesman Chris McKenna knew of no instances of
this in New York -- and Department of Corrections spokesman Jim
Flateau said inmates could currently access little more than
information than is available in phone books -- the task force wants
a prohibition on the books in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Though the lawmakers agreed that some problem areas -- in
particular the Internet -- are a federal responsibility, they said
the state should make sure its own agencies had safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Motor Vehicles alone makes nearly $50 million
a year by selling information from driver's records. Some $2
million of this results from a contract the state has with a direct
marketing firm.
</P>
<P>
   A prohibition against the sale of that information -- one of the
actions recommended by the task force -- would mean a loss of that
income, which Bruno said was a worthy tradeoff.
</P>
<P>
   According to data compiled by PC World Magazine:
</P>
<P>
   --The minimum cost of obtaining an e-mail address for marketing
purposes is 1 cent.
</P>
<P>
   --92 percent of commercial web sites collect personal
information.
</P>
<P>
   --Three of 10 credit card reports contain a serious factual
error.
</P>
<P>
   --$700 million is lost every year to credit card fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty recommendations are to be introduced in a series of
proposals during this legislative session. Among them are measures
to restrict the sale and distribution of personal information and
create civil and criminal penalties for those who steal and abuse
data.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said the Democrat-controlled Assembly appears equally
eager to approve safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Assembly Democrats announced a set of public
hearings on consumer privacy. Last month, Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer, a Democrat, proposed a bill to help Internet users
maintain online privacy and fend off unwanted electronic mails.
