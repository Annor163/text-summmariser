Global warming allegedly accountable for amphibian extinction: 
study

Global warming may have led to
the recent extinction of dozens of amphibian species in tropical 
America, a new study released on Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
The study, to be published in the Jan. 12 issue of the journal 
Nature, presents compelling evidence that global climate change 
created favorable conditions for a pathogenic fungus in Central 
and South America. That fungus, in turn, led to widespread 
extinctions of harlequin frogs at middle elevations of mountainous
regions.
</P>
<P>
Tropical America is just one of many regions that have been 
dramatically losing amphibian species over the past few decades. 
In 2004, the first global assessment of amphibians revealed that 
almost a third of the world's known species are threatened with 
extinction.
</P>
<P>
Studies have pointed to some causes for these deaths, including
infections, habitat loss and changing temperature or rain 
patterns.  Amphibians, with their moist, breathable skins, are 
thought to be particularly sensitive to environmental change.
</P>
<P>
But the root of the problem in many places, often in seemingly 
pristine habitats, has remained elusive.
</P>
<P>
In this new work, the researchers led by Alan Pounds of the 
Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve in Costa Rica, set out to test 
whether the deadly fungus living on the frogs' skin, 
Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, should be blamed for the loss of 
some 70 of species harlequin frog (Atelopus) from Central and 
South America.
</P>
<P>
The team first mapped the timing of species disappearances 
against changes in sea-surface and air temperature over the past 
few decades, and found that the frogs are disappearing almost 
exactly in step with climate change.
</P>
<P>
But it was not clear how the link between species loss and 
climate change worked: the world is generally warming, but the 
fungus is thought to be more deadly in cooler climes.
</P>
<P>
So the team looked at 50 sites from Costa Rica to Peru. It 
found that the frogs were doing worst in areas where night-time 
temperatures are getting warmer but day-time temperatures are 
cooler-- conditions that favor the fungus.
</P>
<P>
The most likely connection, the researchers said, is that 
large-scale warming is accelerating the formation of clouds. This 
in turn makes local conditions kinder on the fungus, and spells 
bad news for the frogs.
</P>
<P>
The fungus may be killing amphibians worldwide in warmer 
climate, and in a similar way, the disease dynamics altered by the
global warming may affect broad regions, many animal species and 
ultimately humans, other scientists warned.
