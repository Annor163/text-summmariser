<P>
Conservationists in Sri Lanka, the 
world's top spot for frogs, have discovered 35 new species of the 
amphibians -- only to find that another 19 species have died out.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's Wildlife Heritage Trust, in a report to be published 
Thursday, blames habitat loss on the tropical island for the 
die-off.
</P>
<P>
"The ravages of habitat loss in Sri Lanka's once rain-forested 
wet zone have been severe, and there is a compelling argument for 
intensive conservation management of the surviving forest," the 
Trust's Rohan Pethiyagoda wrote in the report.
</P>
<P>
In a decade-long study, a Wildlife Heritage Trust team found 
evidence of 35 new frog species, confirming the Indian Ocean island 
as the world's number one spot for frogs, with more than 200 known 
species, ahead even of rainforest-rich, biodiverse Costa Rica, 
Pethiyagoda told AFP.
</P>
<P>
They also found other previously unknown biodiversity -- 50 new 
snail species, 16 new crabs, seven new lizards and an as yet unknown 
species of mouse deer, he said.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people thought we had documented all the species 
during the time of the British (1815-1948), but what we are 
discovering is that it is not the case and we are finding more," the 
internationally acclaimed conservationist wrote in the latest 
Raffles Bulletin of Zoology, to be published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"These discoveries provide, however, little cause for 
jubilation," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Conservation Union, 19 of the 34 
amphibian species identified as extinct worldwide are from Sri 
Lanka, Pethiyagoda said.
</P>
<P>
Mourning the lack of effort made to protect the animals and 
their inland habitat, he said: "I wish they had been affected by the 
tsunami because then we would have got some foreign assistance for 
conservation."
</P>
<P>
While the December tsunami killed some 31,000 people and damaged 
the island's fragile coral reefs, it did not affect the frog 
population because they were not concentrated near coastlines as 
they dislike salt water, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka may be the country with the highest number of endemic 
frog species, but it has also seen the fastest die-off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The timeline and the causes of the extinction of the 19 species, 
however, were still poorly understood, Pethiyagoda said.
</P>
<P>
"We can't be sure when exactly that happened, and we don't know 
for sure what caused the extinction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be disease or loss of their habitat, because in this 
country we don't have the practice of eating frogs."
</P>
<P>
His research calls for greater conservation in Sri Lanka, where 
only 750 square kilometres (290 square miles) of an original 16,000 
square kilometres (6,177 square miles) of rainforest remain.
</P>
<P>
Pethiyagoda said he first noticed the rich variety of Sri 
Lanka's frog life while studying freshwater fish and crabs in the 
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"Our unearthing of this remarkable speciosity in Sri Lanka 
Philautus (frogs) was accidental," Pethiyagoda wrote. The find was 
"indeed serendipitous", but "the evidence we present of a large 
scale extinction is indeed sobering."
