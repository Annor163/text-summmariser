Greenpeace is seeking to raise 
awareness of the need to protect ancient forests in Indonesia's 
Papua, where a virtual "lost world" of new species was discovered 
last year, an activist said Tuesday.

Greenpeace's flagship Rainbow Warrior steamed into the Papuan 
capital Jayapura last week for a series of forums in Indonesia's 
easternmost province, Greenpeace Southeast Asia forest campaigner 
Hapsoro told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The environmental watchdog has also been setting up forestry 
initiatives aimed at protecting dwindling forests.
</P>
<P>
In Manokwari, Papua's second city, Greenpeace held a forum for 
forestry students Tuesday, Hapsoro said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the students are the future generation who will 
save the forests in Papua," he said.
</P>
<P>
Deforestation rates in Indonesia are among the highest in the 
world and in the last five years the archipelago nation has lost an 
average area equivalent to six football fields a minute, Greenpeace 
says.

<P>
Scientists from environmental group Conservation International 
(CI) last December found an area dubbed a "lost world" that was home 
to dozens of new species in Papua's Foja Mountains.
</P>
<P>
Experts found species that had never been described before, 
including frogs, butterflies, plants and an orange-faced honeyeater, 
the first new bird found on the island in more than 60 years.
</P>
<P>
"Our discovery of new species underlined the importance of 
saving the pristine forests of Papua. Possibilities are high that we 
will find more new species in the area," CI director Jatna Supriatna 
said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
"These forests, however, are under threat from large-scale 
destruction before we may fully know what kind of flora and fauna 
live in them."
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has already lost more than 72 percent of its large 
intact ancient forest areas and 40 percent of its forests have been 
completely destroyed, Greenpeace said.
