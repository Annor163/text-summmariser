HARBIN, Nov. 26 (Xinhua)

<P>
Water supply in Harbin, capital of 
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, which is now under a 
four-day water cutoff, will be resumed at 11 p.m. on Sunday as 
scheduled, Du Yuxin, secretary of Harbin City Committee of the 
Communist Party of China (CPC) said.
</P>
<P>
"It is an urgent task to resume water supply and we have been 
executing a detailed plan regarding resumption of water supply 
based on suggestions for improvement put forward by experts 
organized by the Ministry of Construction," said Du.

<P>
Harbin, a riverside city that depends on Songhua River for 
water sourcing, has been forced to shut down its water supply 
system for four days starting from wee hours on Wednesday because 
a highly polluted water stretch in the Songhua River, which was 
caused following a blast with a petrochemical plant near one of 
the river's main tributary early this month, has been passing 
through the city.
</P>
<P>
Active carbon absorbent needed for dispelling harmful 
pollutants such as nitrobenzene in the river water are arriving 
from different directions, and more 1,000 armymen and civilians 
have been working around the clock on purifying the water with the
No.3 water plant of Harbin City, according to the party official.
</P>
<P>
There has been no case of poisoning by benzene so far, said Du,
who added the city government in time launched its public health 
emergency response mechanism after the water cutoff was imposed.
</P>
<P>
Benzene and nitrobenzene flew into the No.2 Songhua River, a 
key tributary of Songhua River, following a blast with China 
National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) Jilin Petrochemical company,
a petrochemical plant in Jilin Province, a close neighbor of 
Heilongjiang Province, on Nov.13.
</P>
<P>
China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) 
confirmed that Songhua River suffered a major water pollution 
incident.
