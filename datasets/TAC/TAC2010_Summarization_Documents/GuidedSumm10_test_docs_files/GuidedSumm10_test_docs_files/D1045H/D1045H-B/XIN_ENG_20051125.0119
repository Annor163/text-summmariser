BEIJING, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- A central government work group 
leaves here Friday for the northeastern Harbin city to investigate
into the pollution of the Songhua River, now officially 
categorized as a "major water pollution incident."
</P>
<P>
The presence of disciplinary officials in the team indicates 
punishments of irresponsible acts are on the way.
</P>
<P>
The incident, caused by the November 13 blast of a chemical 
plant near the river, has stunned the whole nation. It has been 
horrible for more than 3 million people of Harbin to be bereft of 
water for four days.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have sent strong messages in the past few days,
ordering the relevant departments to ensure the safety of drinking
water, closely follow the pollution situation and provide accurate
information.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the State Council set targets of combating 
environmental degradation for the next 15 years. By 2020, China's 
environmental quality and ecological status should be improved 
remarkably, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Thursday, a senior environmental official
said the government will adopt more rigorous measures to reduce 
the overall discharge of pollutants into rivers and lakes in the 
next five years.
</P>
<P>
"During the coming five years, the State Environmental 
Protection Administration will ban all sewage outfalls in water 
source protection zones to guarantee the safety of drinking water 
for the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The media in China have given blanket coverage to developments 
of the pollution upon eager requests from the public. The incident
has stimulated widespread reflection about China's environmental 
conditions. The popularity of the issue is evident from voluminous
postings on Internet bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
Environmental awareness in China, which is rising as fast as 
the country's wealth, has received a boost from the incident.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, east China's Shanghai revealed Thursday
it is drafting environmental standards for district leaders. 
Compliance with the standards will influence the promotion or 
demotion of cadres.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, 19 provinces jointly submitted a suggestion to
the State Council on enhancing the ecological protection of inland
lakes and instituting a mechanism that takes environmental 
conditions into account when evaluating regional development, 
dubbed the "Green GDP" evaluation system.
</P>
<P>
The system has long been touted as an effective measure to 
concretely advance environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The general public obviously has also becomes more aware of the
preciousness of a sound environmental situation from the Songhua 
River incident.
</P>
<P>
"Though the water supply cutoff has caused much difficulties 
and inconvenience, it is also a good opportunity for us," said 
Zhou Yajuan, a female school teacher in Harbin. "It is a perfect 
example for us to teach our kids about the need to save and care 
for our water resources."
</P>
<P>
The current event is set to become a catalyst for fundamental 
change. Now that China has learned and matured from the SARS 
experience, it is also likely to take a big stride forward after 
the Songhua River pollution incident.
</P>
<P>
Conditions for the change are all there. It needs only a little
more push, followed by focused and well-organized efforts.
</P>
<P>
World environmental protection equipment manufacturers should 
keep an eye out for that.
