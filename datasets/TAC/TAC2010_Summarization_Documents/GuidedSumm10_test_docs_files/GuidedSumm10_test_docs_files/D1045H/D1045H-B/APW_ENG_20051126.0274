A top official with the government's environmental safety agency visited
Russia's far eastern regions Saturday to deal with the threat from tons of
chemical pollutants flowing down a river from China, while Russia's ambassador
to Beijing demanded information about the accident.
</P>
<P>
Oleg Mitvol, deputy chief of the Federal Service for Supervision of Natural
Resources, visited the Khabarovsk region on the border with China to help mount
a response to the spill of benzene into the Songhua River after an explosion at
a chemical plant.

<P>
The deadly chemical was expected to reach Khabarovsk, a city of 580,000, early
next month. In remarks broadcast by Russian television, Mitvol said that he had
arranged for a quick upgrade of the city's water purification
facilities.

<P>
Meanwhile, Russia's Ambassador to Beijing Sergei Razov met Saturday with Chinese
Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing to discuss the chemical threat. Razov urged Beijing
to provide full information about the toxic spill, according to the ITAR-Tass
and RIA Novosti news agencies.
</P>
<P>
Razov said the response to the accident would have been more efficient if China
had informed Russia about it sooner, the reports said, adding that Li offered
China's assistance to help deal with the spill's consequences.
</P>
<P>
As the 3.8 million residents of the Chinese city of Harbin endured a fourth day
without water, residents of Khabarovsk, 700 kilometers (435 miles) downriver,
rushed to stockpile bottled water _ provoking shortages and a nearly twofold
rise in prices.
</P>
<P>
The Songhua flows into the Heilong River, which crosses the border and becomes
the Amur in Russia, flowing through Khabarovsk.
