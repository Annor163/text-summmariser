Armed police commandos were deployed on trains traveling in Pakistan's
southwestern Baluchistan province on Wednesday, a day after bombings damaged a
portion of a rail track and wounded three policemen, an official
said.

Up to five commandos will guard each passenger train traveling through the
province and metal detectors have been installed at stations, said railways
police official Naeem Kakar in the provincial capital Quetta.

On Tuesday, a civilian and three policemen were injured when a bomb planted on a
railway exploded while the police were trying to remove it, said Naseebullah
Khan, a police official in Jafarabad, a town southeast of Quetta where the
explosion occurred.

One of the injured men was listed in serious condition but it was not clear
whether he was a policemen or the civilian.

Five hours later, another bomb blew up a 2-foot (60 centimeter) section of the
track on the same line, Khan said

The railroads in Baluchistan have been targeted in a spate of small scale
attacks, blamed on ethnic nationalists.

Khan said two ethnic Baluch men were arrested Wednesday in connection with the
two explosions on Tuesday. He did not identify them.

Baluch nationalist groups have been angered over plans by the central government
to build new military garrisons in Baluchistan. They also demand an increase in
royalty for resources extracted in their areas.
