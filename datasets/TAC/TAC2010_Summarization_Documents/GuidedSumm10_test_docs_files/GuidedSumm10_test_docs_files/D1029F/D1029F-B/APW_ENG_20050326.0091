At least three Pakistani soldiers were wounded when suspected tribesman fired a
dozen rockets at their headquarters in the country's troubled southwest, a
military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Frontier Corps spokesman Lt. Col. Rizwan Malik said the rockets fired from the
cover of nearby mountains hit their regional headquarters late Friday at
Barakhan, a town about 370 kilometers (230 miles) east of Quetta.
</P>
<P>
The attack wounded three soldiers, two of them critically, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Frontier Corps troops returned fire, but it wasn't known if the attackers
suffered any casualties, Malik said.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the attack, Mir Azad Baluch, who often speaks for a nationalist
group called Baluchistan National Liberation Army, contacted reporters in Quetta
and claimed responsibility for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that more attacks were likely unless authorities agree to pay
more royalties for gas extracted in their territories.
</P>
<P>
Rocket attacks targeting gas fields and troops are common in Baluchistan, of
which Quetta is the capital. Officials blame tribesmen for the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
On March 18, a fierce gunbattle broke out between troops and tribesmen near Dere
Bugti's gas-rich area, leaving dozens of people dead, including eight
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Since then, authorities have been holding talks with a renegade tribal elder
Nawab Akbar Bugti to resolve the problem through peaceful talks.
</P>
<P>
However, the continued tension has raised fears of a repeat of an uprising that
rocked parts of the province in the 1970s, when thousands died. President Gen.
Pervez Musharraf has warned the tribesmen not to push his government too far,
saying the consequences will be severe.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have deployed thousands of troops in Baluchistan to protect gas
fields.
