Four soldiers were fighting 
for their lives Tuesday after a landmine exploded beneath their jeep 
in Pakistan's unruly southwestern province of Baluchistan, the 
military said.

A paramilitary Frontier Corps convoy was on its way to Kahan, 
400 kilometers (250 miles) southeast of the provincial capital 
Quetta when the mine blew up one of the vehicles, army spokesman 
Lieutenant Colonel Rizwan Malik told AFP.

"We rushed helicopters to airlift the wounded soldiers," he 
said, adding that were flown to a military hospital in Sui, where 
Pakistan's largest gasfield is located.

"Their condition is critical," Rizwan said.

Kahan lies in the tribal-dominated Kohlu district which has been 
hit by frequent rocket attacks and bomb blasts.

No one claimed responsibility for the blast.

However resource-rich Baluchistan has been gripped since last 
year by a revolt by tribesmen who demand more economic rights from 
the the province's natural resources.

Paramilitary troops and tribal rebels have been locked in a 
standoff in the town of Dera Bugti, near Sui, since a violent clash 
on March 17 left dozens of civilians and eight troops dead.
