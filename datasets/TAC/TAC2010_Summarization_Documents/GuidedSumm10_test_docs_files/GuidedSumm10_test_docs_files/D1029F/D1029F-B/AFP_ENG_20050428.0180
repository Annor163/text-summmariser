QUETTA, Pakistan, April 28

<P>
Pakistan has deployed police 
commandos to guard trains and railway stations after frequent blasts 
in its insurgency-hit southwestern province, officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The move comes in the wake of attacks in Baluchistan by 
nationalist tribesmen demanding more political rights, jobs and 
royalties from the province's natural resources.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to deploy paramilitary soldiers along with up 
to 30 policemen at every rural and urban station in the province," 
divisional superintendent of the railways, Ali Hassan, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 armed policemen with radio communication systems 
will travel on each train, he said.
</P>
<P>
The authorities in January also posted police commandos on 
trains after a surge in violence and later banned all trains from 
running at night after blasts on a mainline disrupted traffic from 
the provincial capital Quetta to the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying our best to make the journey safe."
</P>
<P>
Hassan said that railway authorities had received new equipment 
from the United States to scan the luggage and destroy explosive 
devices.
</P>
<P>
"The equipment, including locators, detectors and destroyers, 
has already been installed to check belongings of passengers at 
almost all stations."
</P>
<P>
Bomb blasts have recently ripped through trains in the province 
while railway tracks in the region have repeatedly been blown up by 
insurgents.
</P>
<P>
Four policemen were injured on Tuesday when they tried to remove 
a bomb from a railway track shortly after a blast nearby damaged the 
line in the restive region.
</P>
<P>
Seven people were injured in a blast in the toilet of a train 
compartment earlier this month while a similar explosion in March 
left one man dead.
</P>
<P>
Most of the attacks were claimed by a shadowy group called the 
Baluchistan Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
The group is believed to have links to renegade tribesmen, who 
have stepped up attacks on key installations and security forces in 
the impoverished province to press their demands.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has moved thousands of troops into Baluchistan after a 
rocket barrage on a gas plant at Sui left eight people dead in 
January.
</P>
<P>
Nationalists tribes also oppose a government plan to build three 
new military garrisons in Baluchistan.
