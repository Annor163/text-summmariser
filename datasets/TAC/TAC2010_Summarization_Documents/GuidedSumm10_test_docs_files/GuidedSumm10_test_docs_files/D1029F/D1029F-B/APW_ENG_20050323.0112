<P>
A standoff between Pakistani soldiers and thousands of tribesmen threatened to
explode Wednesday, after a tribal chief accused security forces of killing
dozens of civilians while a local military commander warned of a devastating
confrontation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Days after deadly clashes, both sides say they want a peaceful solution, but
each accuses the other of sparking the standoff.
</P>
<P>
The commander, Brig. Salim Nawaz, said on Tuesday that thousands of Bugti
tribesmen armed with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons have
surrounded a military base near Dera Bugti, in Pakistan's southwestern
Baluchistan province, with some setting up roadblocks and digging
trenches.
</P>
<P>
"The Dera Bugti area is cut off," Nawaz told journalists. "People need to leave
that area so that a major crisis is averted."
</P>
<P>
Journalists and lawmakers who traveled to the area under military escort were
able to enter the base in a convoy without incident, however, and the tribal
leader denied his men were beseiging the base.
</P>
<P>
In the desert town, hundreds of turbaned tribesmen swarmed around the convoy,
shouting support for tribal leader Nawab Akbar Bugti and waving green and red
flags. There was no violence.
</P>
<P>
Bugti, a wealthy, silver-haired man who speaks impeccable English, accused the
government of starting the conflict.
</P>
<P>
He said troops initiated fighting on Thursday that left 62 people dead _
including 32 minority Hindus who died when their temple and surrounding homes
came under attack. He condemned the troops as "murderers who launched a
massacre," and said he barely escaped injury when troops fired mortar shells
into his compound, killing two people sitting just three meters (10 feet) from
him.
</P>
<P>
Tribesmen have been angered by a dispute over royalty rights for natural gas
extracted from the area, and by government plans to set up a new military
garrison.
</P>
<P>
They also are enraged by the rape of a female doctor in the area, allegedly by
members of the military, and by what they say is the government's deliberate
failure to arrest the suspects.
</P>
<P>
Reporters were allowed to enter Bugti's marble-floored compound.
</P>
<P>
Outside his sprawling home, shops were shuttered and heavily armed tribesmen
roamed the streets. Virtually no women ventured outside. Thousands of government
officials, their families, and women and children of local tribesmen have fled
Dera Bugti.
</P>
<P>
The troops and tribesmen have been sticking to a cease-fire since last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz said he hoped to avoid confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"We will use force only as a last resort," he said from Sui, a town 60
kilometers (40 miles) east of Dera Bugti that is the location of key natural gas
installations. "We have the capability to remove them but we are exercising full
restraint so the situation does not get messed up."
</P>
<P>
The fighting broke out Thursday after tribesmen allegedly attacked a military
convoy in mountains near Dera Bugti. Eight troops were reportedly among the
dead.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz said he had no figure on the number of casualties, but acknowledged that
civilians may have also been killed.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot rule it out. Casualties are bound to take place. Full restraint was
taken to avoid collateral damage," he said.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has raised fears of a repeat of an uprising that rocked the region
in the 1970s, when thousands died. President Gen. Pervez Musharraf has warned
the tribesmen not to push his government too far, saying the consequences will
be severe.
