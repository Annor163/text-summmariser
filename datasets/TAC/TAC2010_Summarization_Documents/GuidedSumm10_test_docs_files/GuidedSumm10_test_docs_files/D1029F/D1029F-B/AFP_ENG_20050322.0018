<P>
A parliamentary delegation 
headed Tuesday to a remote town in Pakistan's southwest Baluchistan 
province in a bid to end a siege by hundreds of armed tribesmen.
</P>
<P>
Renegade tribesmen have surrounded some 300 soldiers, government 
officials and their families sheltering at a paramilitary fort in 
the town of Dera Bugti, some 245 kilometres (152 miles) southeast of 
Quetta, since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The tribesmen are demanding more autonomy from the central 
government and increased benefits from the area's natural 
resources.
</P>
<P>
"The parliamentary committee on Baluchistan and a media team 
have left Islamabad this morning for Sui and Dera Bugti," 
information minister Sheikh Rashid told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"The government wants a peaceful resolution of the problems in 
Baluchistan through political dialogue," he added.
</P>
<P>
Baluchistan has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for 
more than a year but the violence surged in January after rebels 
launched a deadly rocket barrage on a major gas plant in revenge for 
the rape of a female doctor.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of troops moved into the province following the 
attack, which killed eight people.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday a barrage of rockets fired at Dera Bugti killed up 
to 30 people including 18 Hindus and eight paramilitary soldiers.
</P>
<P>
It still remains unclear whether the rockets were fired by the 
tribesmen or by Pakistani paramilitary forces.
</P>
<P>
"The tribesmen are less visible today but I would not say that 
they have retreated from their positions," a security official in 
Quetta said Tuesday, requesting anonymity.
</P>
<P>
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising 
which was brutally put down by the government.
