   LANDECK, Austria _ With more snow covering the Alps than almost
anyone could remember, Ulrike Schwarz came to the Austrian Alpine
resort of Galtuer from her home in Germany last week with her two
teen-age children, expecting the best skiing in years.
</P>
<P>
   Since last weekend, though, it had been snowing too hard to ski.
So Mrs. Schwarz, her daughter, Solvieg, and her son, Christoph,
were relaxing in bed on the third floor of their bed-and-breakfast
chalet in the center of Galtuer at 4 p.m. Tuesday when, with an
almighty rumbling, clouds of snow blasted through the windows and
the whole house collapsed beneath them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avalanche!'' Mrs. Schwarz screamed, pushing the children
toward the stairs in the back of the Tyrolean chalet, away from
millions of tons of highly compressed snow carrying rocks and
shredded trees and roaring down upon the village. All three
survived, climbing out of the house through a hole where the roof
had been, and were flown out to an emergency center in Landeck
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities here said Wednesday that they had recovered the
bodies of 16 people, many of them German vacationers, from the
avalanche, which was 15 to 20 feet deep and 300 to 500 feet wide.
They were still looking for 20 to 30 other missing people, feared
dead under the snow.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, 24 hours after the Tuesday avalanche, authorities
said another snowslide, up to 45 feet deep and 600 feet wide, in
the nearby resort of Ischgl had swept away four houses.
</P>
<P>
   Two people, a man and a little girl, were pulled alive from the
snow Wednesday in Ischgl, but a woman was killed and six other
people were believed missing, according to authorities and Austrian
television.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the avalanches were the worst in Austria since a
series of snowslides killed 56 people in the village of Blons in
January 1954.
</P>
<P>
   With Galtuer and Ischgl cut off from road access Wednesday by
the continuing danger of avalanches, information on the latest
deadly slide was scarce. Maj. Thomas Schoenherr, an Austrian
military spokesman, said rescuers in Galtuer had no way of making
their way down the valley Wednesday afternoon to help after the
most recent avalanche in Ischgl, but that others had been flown in
by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The snow is like cement and it's full of pieces of wood and
wreckage,'' Schoenherr said.
</P>
<P>
   After heavy snows over the past two weeks set off avalanches
that killed seven people near the southern Swiss village of Evolene
and 19 people in France, the mood Wednesday at the height of this
Alpine vacation season is edgy. The vacationing skiers and those
who cater to them live for snow; now they are finding that they can
also die from too much of it.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Landeck, more than 20 miles east of Galtuer, Austrian
authorities turned a military barracks compound into an
avalanche-emergency command center for evacuating people from the
stricken resorts and sending in food and other supplies. They
barred all civilian air or road traffic in the area.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Landeck and Galtuer are separated by mountains more than 8,000
to 10,000 feet high, fearsome, jagged peaks that, from the air
Wednesday, looked softened and benign under their heavy coats of
blinding white snow.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, olive drab Austrian Huey helicopters beat their
way down into the narrow landing field of the Landeck barracks
compound for most of the day, taking out about 400 vacationers and
villagers before a heavy snowfall late Wednesday afternoon halted
the flights. Other choppers loaded up with meat, cabbage, potatoes,
tomatoes and milk for the 7,500 tourists in Ischgl and the 600 ski
vacationers still in Galtuer.
</P>
<P>
   The United States flew in six Blackhawk medical evacuation
helicopters to Innsbrueck airport, 60 miles northeast of Galtuer,
to help take people out, but they could not fly in Wednesday
because of the afternoon snow, Schoenherr said.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian television showed video tape, apparently taken by the
rescuers, showing dogs sniffing for survivors and long lines of
rescuers plunging sticks into the snow and digging holes 6-to-10
feet deep in hopes of finding victims still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The tape showed solid three-story concrete and stucco Tyrolean
houses torn apart as if by an earthquake, and automobiles rolled
into crumpled metal balls by the snow.
</P>
<P>
   And it showed rescuers lifting frozen bodies out of the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most painful day of my life,'' said Wendelin
Weingartner, the top elected official in the Austrian Tyrol region.
Eight seriously injured victims were flown to hospitals in
Innsbrueck, where they were all said to be in stable condition
under treatment for hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   European authorities explained the spate of avalanches by the
almost unparalleled amounts of snow that have fallen since the
second week of February and the high winds that have whipped it
into drifts and made it unstable on the crust of earlier snow.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of other resorts in Austria, Switzerland and France have
been cut off from road access for days by the mounting danger of
avalanches. Places like Davos, Switzerland, where the high and
mighty of the worlds of government, industry and finance
congregated at a conference early this month, are now inaccessible
by road or rail, and others, like the fashionable Austrian resorts
of Lech and Zuers, another 60 miles west of here, have been cut off
for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet almost all the resorts have Web sites or television
advertisements that boast of fantastic ski conditions, and most are
clearly expecting a new infusion of guests as soon as the roads
reopen.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Schwarz had a meal in the barracks mess hall after her
ordeal and waited for her husband to come from Germany to pick up
the family.
</P>
<P>
   Would she or her children ever go skiing again? ``Yes, but not
with this much snow,'' Mrs. Schwarz said.
