<P>
VIENNA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- At least eight people have been
confirmed killed and 30 others injured as two avalanches roared
through a ski resort in Austria's western state of Triol on
Tuesday evening, the Austrian news media reported.

<P>
Some 20 people went missing while rescuers are continuing the
searching work.

<P>
Both avalanches rushed down the Alps to the Galtuer resort
nestling in the Paznauntal valley after 4 pm (1500GMT). The snow
wall, 5 meters high and 800 meters long, tore through ten houses
and buried 50 people.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross sources said 30 people have been dug out with injures
in various conditions.
</P>
<P>
A state spokesman said the heavy snow blocking the mountain
roads makes it hard to get the nearly 10,000 besieged skiers out
of the valley in a short time.
