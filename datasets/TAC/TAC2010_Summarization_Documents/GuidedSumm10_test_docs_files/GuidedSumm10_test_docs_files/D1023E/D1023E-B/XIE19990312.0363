<P>
ROME, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Three German tourists were killed by
an avalanche in Italy's northern mountain region near the Austrian
border Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The victims have not been identified, but the rescue workers
said that the victims are two women and a man.
</P>
<P>
One of the two survivors was injured and another was pulled out
of the snow unscathed, rescue workers also reported.
</P>
<P>
The avalanche came off a mountain at about 2,700m high in the
Val di Roia, not far from the Italian border with Austria and
quite close to the Austrian resort of Galtuer, where 38 people
were killed by an avalanche on February 24.
</P>
<P>
Italian authorities said the avalanche was caused by the recent
rise in temperatures in the area, warning that the risk of
avalanche will be very high.
</P>
<P>
One of the two survivors said the five skiers had caused the
avalanche themselves by skiing along the edge of a ridge,
off-slide.
</P>
<P>
The victims have been killed instantly by the giant,
fast-moving mass of snow, rescue workers said.
