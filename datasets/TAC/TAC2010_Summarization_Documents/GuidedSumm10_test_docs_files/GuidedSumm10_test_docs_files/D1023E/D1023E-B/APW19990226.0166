	BOSTON (AP) -- Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts announced today

necessary amount of money with only 10 months to do so, compounded 
by the newly accelerated primary schedule, is simply impossible at 
this time.'' Kerry also said that pulling out of the race could 
help Vice President Al Gore win the Democratic nomination, which 
``may be more helpful to our party's efforts.''
