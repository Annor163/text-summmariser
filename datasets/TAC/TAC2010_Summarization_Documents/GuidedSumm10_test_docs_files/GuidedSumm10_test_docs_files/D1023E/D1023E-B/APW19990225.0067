	Death Sentence in Dragging Case  
</P>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Jurors decided today that John William King  
should be executed for dragging a black man to his death behind a 
pickup truck. The 11 white jurors and their elected black foreman 
took just under three hours to render the decision, about the same 
time they took to find King guilty. They rejected tearful pleas 
from the white racist's sickly father to spare his life. Jurors 
convicted the 24-year-old King of capital murder Tuesday in the 
death of James Byrd Jr. last June.

	Israel Blocks Teen Extradition  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Supreme Court blocked the extradition  
today of a U.S. teen-ager suspected in the dismemberment of an 
acquaintance. The reluctant tones of the judges' 3-2 decision 
keeping Samuel Sheinbein from returning to Maryland to stand trial 
reflected wider embarrassment in Israel over a blanket ban on 
extraditing Jews -- a ban many now believe to be outdated. Justice 
Theodor Orr, writing for the majority, said the law contradicts 
extradition treaties Israel has signed -- but that as long as the 
law was on the books, he had to uphold it.

	Clinton Urges Medicare Plan  
</P>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- President Clinton turned to senior citizens  
today for help in pressuring reluctant Republicans to support his 
plan for mending the ailing Medicare insurance program with 
billions of dollars in budget surpluses. He said Republicans appear 
to be moving away from the across-the-board tax cuts toward 
targeted tax breaks that ``benefit people that need it most.'' 
Clinton's speech at the Tucson Convention Center was the first 
piece of a six-day presidential trip through Western states.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo rebels and the Yugoslav army  
clashed today in defiance of NATO and U.S. warnings that the 
enemies hold to a cease-fire during a 2 1/2-week suspension in peace 
talks. Yugoslav army tanks and mortars were firing near Bukos, a 
village about 20 miles northwest of Pristina where rebel forces are 
concentrated, Associated Press photographers said. More than 2,000 
people have died during fighting in the past year between ethnic 
Albanians and Serb-led Yugoslav forces.

	China Vetoes Macedonia Peacekeepers  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- China lashed back at Macedonia today for  
establishing ties with Taiwan, vetoing a Security Council 
resolution that would have kept U.N. peacekeepers in the strategic 
Balkan country for another six months. Overriding concerns that the 
conflict in neighboring Kosovo could cross the border, Chinese 
Ambassador Qin Huasun cast the vote. It's the fifth time that 
Beijing has used its council veto.

	Austria Avalanche Deaths Rise  
</P>
<P>
	LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- The death toll from two Austrian  
avalanches rose today to 33. In the western village of Galtuer, 
where at least 28 people were killed, scores of rescuers used long 
metal probes to search for at least three people still believed 
buried beneath tons of snow. U.S. Army helicopters helped to fly 
supplies into the stricken area.

	Snow Hits New England  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Low pressure off the coast today brought heavy  
snow to southeastern parts of New England, with up to a foot of 
snow or more in some areas. The heavy snow coupled with wind gusts 
up to 50 mph led to near-blizzard conditions across eastern 
Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Dozens of flights out of Boston's 
Logan Airport were canceled while hundreds of schools throughout 
the region also were closed.

	Tomb of Unknowns May Alter  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon probably will place an  
inscription at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National 
Cemetery in memory of those lost in the Vietnam War rather than 
place new remains in the tomb, officials said. Spokesman Kenneth 
Bacon said Defense Secretary William Cohen had not made a final 
decision but concurred with the view of aides. They concluded that 
it is not possible to say with complete confidence that any future 
remains from Vietnam will be unidentifiable.

	Dow Ends Down 33.33  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A spike in interest rates today pushed stocks,  
which have benefited for a long time from reasonable borrowing 
costs, sharply lower. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 
33.33 at 9,366.34. On the NYSE, losers led gainers 1,962-1,057. The 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 12.56 to 2,326.85.

	Yanks, Nets To Merge Cos.  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees and the NBA's New Jersey  
Nets have signed a letter of intent to merge the two teams into one 
company. However, the teams' current management will remain in 
place, with George Steinbrenner running the Yankees and Lewis Katz 
running the Nets, the teams announced today. The new company, 
called YankeeNets, will enable the Yankees to gain better leverage 
in selling their local broadcast rights.
