<P>
   Alarmed by what they see as the potential for mishaps with
patients taking herbal remedies for everything from depression to
memory loss, anesthesiologists have begun urging people to stop
taking the herbs and supplements before having surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say there is growing evidence that substances like St.
John's wort and ginkgo biloba may have dangerous interactions with
the variety of drugs used to anesthetize patients during surgery.
Although hard scientific evidence of a problem is lacking, they
say, anecdotal reports from hospitals suggest that herbal remedies
may be putting some surgery patients at serious risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing you want is someone who knows enough to keep
you out of trouble,'' said Dr. John B. Neeld Jr., president of the
American Society of Anesthesiologists.
</P>
<P>
   The society recently issued a warning to consumers using herbal
medicine to stop taking the products at least two to three weeks
before any scheduled surgery.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the New York State Society of Anesthesiologists
issued a similar warning. The New York group urged patients who
could not go off the drugs in time to bring in the medication in
its original container and show it to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Patients, however, are often reluctant to tell their doctors
that they are using nontraditional approaches like herbal
medications, said Dr. Carole W. Agin, director of the pain
management clinic in Port Jefferson, N.Y. ``I think patients fear
that it will somehow drive a wedge between the patient-physician
relationship,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans spend about $5 billion a year on herbal products,
which, unlike prescription drugs, are not fully regulated by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Often, little is known about the substances, their effects and
their interactions with other drugs. And, in some cases, little is
done to assure quality control. Only in rare cases, like the one
involving the stimulant ephedra, when there are persistent reports
of injury or death, does the government take action against an
herbal product.
</P>
<P>
   Anesthesiologists say they are taking no position on the use in
general of herbal remedies, which are sometimes being incorporated
into the practice of traditional medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most common herbals are St. John's wort, which is
said to help with mild depression, and ginkgo, which is taken to
improve memory and blood circulation. Doctors also singled out two
other popular remedies: feverfew, which is said to help ease
migraine headaches; and ginseng, which is taken to improve
vitality.
</P>
<P>
   The possible interactions include an unintended deepening of the
effects of some anesthetics and problems with blood pressure and
bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   One situation that some doctors suspect might be happening in
operating rooms involves ephedra, which, despite being banned by
the federal Food and Drug Administration, is still being taken in
other forms.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, Neeld said, patients in surgery suddenly show
signs of a drop in blood pressure. The anesthesiologist will then
administer a drug like ephedrine, to bring the pressure back up.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Neeld said, doctors have been surprised to see
the blood pressure shoot back up to dangerous levels that could
cause a stroke or heart attack. The patients later said they had
been taking ephedra.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors emphasize that much study needs to be done to establish
whether there is a real risk for patients taking herbal remedies.
``All of the concern may prove totally unwarranted down the line,''
Neeld said.
</P>
<P>
   The growing herbal industry has raised no objection to the
doctors' warning. Dr. Phillip W. Harvey, director of science and
quality assurance at the National Nutritional Foods Association,
whose 4,000 members make and sell herbal remedies, called the
caution common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would whole-heartedly support that,'' Harvey said.
