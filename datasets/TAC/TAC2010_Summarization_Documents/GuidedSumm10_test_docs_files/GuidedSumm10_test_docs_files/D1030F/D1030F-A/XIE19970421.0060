<HEADLINE> China Starts Massive Campaign against Narcotic Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China announced today it will
carry out a massive targeted fight against narcotics-related
crimes from this month through the end of September, to curb
rampant drug smuggling and the increase of drug use.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was outlined at a national anti-drug conference
late last month, and announced today by the National Committee of
Narcotics Control (NCNC).
</P>
<P>
According to the NCNC, the Chinese authorities have attached
great importance to the drug problem since it re-emerged in the
country in the early 1980s, and have launched a series of
offensives against drug-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
Influenced by worsening international drug crimes, China is now
confronted with an unprecedented situation: 520,000 drug users
across the country had been registered with government medical
institutions by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
But some local authorities have not fully recognized the
seriousness of the problem, and have not done enough to crack down
on drug-related crime, the NCNC said.
</P>
<P>
It was discovered that some grassroots level authorities have
privately given the green light to drug growers, which has
stimulated the spread of drug production and use.
</P>
<P>
The NCNC demanded party and government bodies at all levels
concentrate on the problems of drug use, planting and trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Tight control should be exercised in regions that produce
natural ephedra, which is used to make methamphetamine, or "ice,"
and all illegal dealings in the substance should be eliminated,
the NCNC said.
</P>
<P>
Departments concerned must avoid wranglings over duties and
responsibilities and coordinate with each other, it was urged.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the NCNC said, criminals involved in
drug-related activities must be dealt with strictly in accordance
with law, and fines should never be levied in place of harsher
punishment.
</P>
<P>
It also encouraged public trials to be held for the offenders
in order to educate the public and deter crime, and to mobilize
the public to actively participate in the anti-drug drive,
according to the NCNC.
</P>
<P>
The NCNC set up a general headquarters today for the campaign
and published a hotline number, 65204111, to take reports and
opinions and offer legal advice.
