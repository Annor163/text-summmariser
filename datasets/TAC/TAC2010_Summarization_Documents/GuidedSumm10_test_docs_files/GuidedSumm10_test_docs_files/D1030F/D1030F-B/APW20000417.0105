<HEADLINE> Concerns Raised About Ephedra  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 38-year-old California man gulped his
usual two capsules of the herbal supplement ephedra with a cup of
coffee, then went on his daily jog. Later that morning, he dropped
dead from cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   A 35-year-old apparently healthy ephedra user collapsed during
aerobics class with a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts say cases like these show a clear risk from the
herbal stimulant -- yet with millions of Americans taking the
supplements but reports of possible side effects in the hundreds,
just who's at risk is a major question.
</P>
<P>
   Do you need a checkup before popping the pills? Is taking
ephedra with caffeine or while vigorously exercising the problem?
Is it the dose?
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration is struggling to figure that
out. Heeding industry protests, the agency just dramatically scaled
back an attempt to regulate ephedra-containing dietary supplements.
Now, armed with 273 new reports of problems like the ones above,
the agency is grappling with whether the supplements at least need
warning labels.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a dilemma for FDA,'' said Dr. Neal Benowitz of the
University of California, San Francisco, who studied the issue for
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Ephedra poses ''serious risks to subsets of the population,''
Benowitz added. Until doctors spell that out more specifically,
consumers must ''know these are not totally benign substances.
They've got drugs in them. They've got serious side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the issue further, a University of Arkansas study
to be published in next month's American Journal of Health-System
Pharmacy tested 20 different ephedra-containing supplements and
found half contained very different ephedra doses than the bottles
promised -- sometimes lots less, sometimes lots more.
</P>
<P>
   Ephedra, also known by the Chinese name ma huang, is the herbal
form of ephedrine, an amphetamine-like stimulant. Ephedrine is sold
in a few FDA-regulated over-the-counter asthma medications.
</P>
<P>
   But herbal ephedra is sold in 200 unregulated dietary
supplements, for weight loss, building muscle or boosting energy,
and occasionally in large doses as an ''herbal high.''
</P>
<P>
   Ephedra manufacturers insist that overall, the herb is safe.
After all, millions regularly use it without problem.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in some people, ephedra is linked to anxiety, sleeplessness,
migraines, high blood pressure, seizures, irregular heartbeats,
heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   It first made headlines when an otherwise healthy 20-year-old
college student died from ephedra in 1996. Ultimately, the FDA
cited 800 reports of side effects, including 44 deaths, and
proposed federal regulations to, among other things, slash the
legal dose.
</P>
<P>
   The dietary supplements industry furiously opposed the rules,
and Congress' General Accounting Office said last year that while
ephedra did seem risky to some people, the FDA's crackdown was
based on sloppy science. So the FDA backed off.
</P>
<P>
   Now the fight's back on: The FDA this month released 273
additional reports of side effects among ephedra users. Agency and
independent physicians combed medical records to determine how many
of the first 140 reports the herb really caused and how many were
coincidence. Resulting numbers vary, but all found some danger. Now
the FDA wants warning labels; it plans a public hearing this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, what should consumers know?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, people with heart disease or high blood pressure are at
risk from stimulants, including ephedra, Benowitz says. Other risk
factors: kidney or thyroid disease, a history of seizures, or
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Warning labels could help such people, although Benowitz says
the California jogger apparently didn't realize he had seriously
blocked arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Six ephedra manufacturers who just formed the Ephedra Education
Council concede some risk: Unlike most companies, they have begun
using warning labels urging caution if consumers have such
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Yet council spokesman Theodore Farber contends if ephedra were
really dangerous, FDA-approved ephedrine for asthma would cause
problems, too.
</P>
<P>
   Benowitz responds that asthmatics can indeed suffer side
effects, but that far more people take ephedra supplements, for far
longer, without a doctor's care.
</P>
<P>
   And, he notes, some ephedra users with no obvious medical
problems, like that aerobics-loving stroke victim, suffer
reactions. Why? Nobody knows, but he has two suspicions: Many
ephedra supplements also contain a cup of coffee's worth of
caffeine, another stimulant, so a few capsules a day really rev
people up.
</P>
<P>
   Also, ''I'd be hesitant to have someone take this before a
really intense workout,'' he said, noting a number of serious side
effects occurred among exercising stimulant users.
