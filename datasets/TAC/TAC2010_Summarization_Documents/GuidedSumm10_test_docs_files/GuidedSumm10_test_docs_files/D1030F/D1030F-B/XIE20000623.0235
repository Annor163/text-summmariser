<HEADLINE> China Bans Picking, Trade in Sand-Fixing Wild Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government has banned
the picking and trade of wild algae and excessive digging of
licorice and Chinese ephedra in northern China in a bid to protect
the fragile ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
In a recent circular, the State Council, the highest governing
body, said the wild and sand-fixing plants are listed under State
protection and management, as they play an important role in
protecting the eco-environment, particularly grass.
</P>
<P>
But rampant picking and digging of the wild plants in recent
years has resulted in the deterioration and desertification of
grassland, serious damage to the ecological environment, and had a
negative impact on the production and life of farmers and herdsmen
in the affected areas, said the circular.
</P>
<P>
The circular urged local governments at all levels to stop
local residents from picking and digging the wild plants, and take
necessary measures to ban the trade of the plants.
</P>
<P>
It said checkpoints should be set up to block entry into the
growing areas for those wild plants.
</P>
<P>
Algae, a black hair-like plant, has been popular as the Chinese
pronunciation of the word is similar to "facai," which means "
making a fortune" in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The circular called for licensed digging and monopolized trade
of licorice and Chinese ephedra, and demarking areas where digging
is forbidden.
</P>
<P>
The circular also called on local governments for similar
control of picking, digging and trading of other sand-fixing wild
plants, such as ramee and Chinese caterpillar fungus.
