   NEW YORK _ When the latest book on herbal remedies landed on my
desk, my first reaction was to put it in the giveaway pile with all
the rest of the home remedy books, especially after Page 1 brought
me face to face with cures like gin-soaked raisins for arthritis
and Archway coconut macaroons for diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   But when I saw who wrote the book, ``The People's Pharmacy Guide
to Home and Herbal Remedies'' (St. Martin's $27.95), I decided to
put aside skepticism. The authors, Joe Graedon, a pharmacologist,
and Teresa Graedon, a medical anthropologist, have been writing
sound and sensible books about drugs for nonscientists for more
than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In their latest, the couple lay out not only the pluses but also
the minuses of self-medication in language that is easy to
understand. If you want a single source of good information without
the usual hype, this is the book to choose.
</P>
<P>
   As a skeptic of most of the claims made for herbs and dietary
supplements, I had a hard time getting past the peripheral advice:
garlic to get rid of fleas, cider vinegar to cure headaches and
cherries to relieve gout.
</P>
<P>
   The Graedons do not say these home remedies necessarily work,
certainly not for everyone, but they do say the remedies are
harmless, so why not give them a try.
</P>
<P>
   But once I moved on to the scientific information, I was more
impressed. Readers should resist the temptation to jump to their
favorite ailment before reading Pages 7 through 22, which offer
valuable precautions. The book ``is not intended as a substitute
for the medical advice of a physician,'' write the authors, who
also warn that ``home remedies are generally untested'' and that
``any symptom that persists or gets worse should be attended to by
a physician.''
</P>
<P>
   As for interactions between herbal remedies and prescription
drugs, the Graedons advise: ``Please recognize that not all
interactions have been discovered or reported in the literature,''
and ``long-term side effects and interactions, in particular, have
not been well explored.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Graedons' book was being released, the Food and Drug
Administration issued a warning that St. John's wort causes
``significant drug interaction'' with the prescription drug
indinavir, used to treat HIV infection. And it was only last week
that a conference sponsored in part by the National Institutes of
Health called for regulation of medicinal herbs, though some
speakers noted it might be too late. Americans spend an estimated
$4 billion a year on herbal supplements, and the Graedons note that
the industry is ``virtually immune from regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these caveats, the authors think that ``used sensibly,
herbs and home remedies can be of great help in self-care'' and
that they ``appear amazingly benign when compared with prescription
medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is divided into two parts: an alphabetical list of
common ailments from asthma to warts, and a guide to herbal
therapies from aloe to valerian.
</P>
<P>
   A typical segment in the first section comes under the heading
for insomnia. It discusses the impact of caffeine, exercise,
relaxation, snacking and television, as well as the use of herbs
like chamomile, valerian, hops, kava-kava and lavender. It also
describes melatonin, a naturally occurring hormone that is crucial
for setting the body's sleep cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The Graedons have some cautions about its use. That said, they
fail to discuss the safety of using a hormone _ any hormone _ on a
regular basis without medical supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The section on asthma notes that the condition is so serious
that ``we do not believe its treatment is a do-it-yourself
project.'' But, the authors write, adding vitamin C to the diet of
someone under the care of a physician would not be risky, and some
evidence suggests that vitamin C can be beneficial to lung
function.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Graedons recommend against the Chinese herb
ephedra, or ma huang, as a primary treatment for asthma, although
many herbal reference books suggest it. They point out that its
effects are short-lived and that it has a number of very serious
side effects ranging from irregular heartbeat to death.
</P>
<P>
   The second section of the book, which deals with herbal
therapies, provides all the information about each herb in one
place, including active ingredients, dose, special precautions,
adverse effects and possible interactions. Under chamomile, for
instance, readers will learn that it is used to treat digestive
distress (see Peter Rabbit and chamomile tea) and as a mild sleep
aid; that people who are allergic to ragweed and chrysanthemums
probably shouldn't use it; and that ingesting a large amount of its
dried flowers may cause vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   As for gin-soaked raisins and Archway cookies, the Graedons
don't pretend to know why some people find them useful, which is
reason enough to recommend ``The People's Pharmacy Guide to Home
and Herbal Remedies'' as the most sensible book of its kind. &QL;
