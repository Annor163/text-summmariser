<HEADLINE> China to Restrict Digging in Grassland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua)-- China, a country taking pride in
its traditional herbal medicine, is considering how to limit
digging plants for such usage in grassland.
</P>
<P>
Digging for wild plants and herbs usually destroys grass
growing around them, resulting eventually in the environmental
destruction, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
If excessive digging continues, the great Hulunbuir Pasture
which has a grassland of 149 million mu, or 9.98 million hectares,
will become a desert within 10 years, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Major herbal plants being dug for include liquor ice, Chinese
ephedra, Chongcao (Chinese Caterpillar fungus) and Facai, a
precious wild vegetable.
</P>
<P>
To limit digging such plants is by no means an easy task, not
only because many poor people make a living by digging herbal
plants, but also because administrators concerned lack fund and
necessary experience to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
However, the government of Inner Mongolia, China's major
grassland province, has decided to curb the excessive digging.
</P>
<P>
Its measures include limiting the number of permissions granted
to the diggers and dealers, and strengthening co-operations
between police and departments concerned.
