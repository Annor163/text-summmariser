<P>
   If you grab an energy-boosting bar or drink for a quick lift,
you might get more than you expect.
</P>
<P>
   Some popular energy boosters sold at health stores and on the
Internet often contain dangerously high quantities of the herb
ephedra, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Ephedra is considered a ``dietary supplement'' and therefore is
not controlled by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The
stimulant can raise blood pressure and heart rate, cause vomiting,
heart palpitations, dizziness, nervousness and more serious
reactions including heart attacks, seizures and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Sass, a registered dietician at the University of
Florida in Tampa who has studied ephedra in energy foods, says most
people are unaware of the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people are under the impression that if it's
on the shelf, it must be safe; if it's on the shelf, it must be
regulated, but we know that's not true,'' Sass says.
</P>
<P>
   She cites federal figures showing 800 cases of adverse reactions
_ some as serious as heart attacks, seizures and strokes _ linked
to ephedra. The herb also has been blamed for a dozen deaths, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Ephedra, derived from an Asiatic shrub, contains ephedrine, a
stimulant that acts on the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Sass says high doses of the popular herb are especially
dangerous for people with high blood pressure or heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   A single portion of some energy-boosting bars contain as much as
300 milligrams of ephedra, far more than the 24-milligrams-a-day
maximum recommended by the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   ``When customers buy a product that claims to be an energy
booster, they should ask what it contains and where the energy
boost is supposed to come from,'' Sass says. ``It's really up to
the consumers to be educated about the product they're taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulations govern ephedra in 21 states, but Sass says they vary
widely, and the energy-boosters are easy to find on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ephedra also can interact with medications and increase or
counter their effect, Sass says.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reaching for a quick energy boost, Sass suggests
healthier alternatives including small, frequent meals and snacks
of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, yogurt and proteins found in
peanut butter, soy and lean meats.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she says turning to energy-boosters that rely heavily
on stimulants like ephedra could mask the real causes of low
energy, such as diabetes or other medical conditions, poor
nutrition or lack of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are experiencing a low energy level, they really
need to look at what's going on with their lifestyles instead of
reaching for a product,'' Sass says.
</P>
<P>
   John Cordaro, president and CEO of the Washington-based Council
for Responsible Nutrition, which represents supplement makers and
suppliers, says ephedra has gotten a bad name because of misuse. He
says labels on most products he found recommend no more than 100
milligrams a day.
</P>
<P>
   The council is commissioning an independent investigation of the
herb to sort fact from fiction, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people read the warnings statements, and if the warning
applies to them, they stay away from the product. And if people use
it as directed, then the product should be safe for most people,''
Cordaro says.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice is: number one, read the label; number two, know the
company that you're buying from, and number three, if you have any
question about the company or the product, and it doesn't have an
800 number, ask the pharmacist or health-store clerk to get you to
the company,'' he says. ``And, finally, use as directed.''
