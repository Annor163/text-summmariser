HERBS THAT CLASH WITH MEDICATIONS

<P>
   A congestive heart failure patient had been doing well on
prescription medications for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on a regular checkup, her physician noticed the health of
her heart seemed to be heading downhill. The puzzled doctor was on
the verge of doing a biopsy when he learned the woman was taking
the herb hawthorne, said to help with some circulatory disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hawthorne was canceling the woman's heart medications in
ways that are still not quite clear,'' says Steven B. Karch, M.D.,
toxicologist, expert on narcotic abuse and author of ''The
Consumer's Guide to Herbal Medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But as soon as the woman stopped taking hawthorne, the health
of her heart improved and remained stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicians and other health experts are now learning that other
herbs taken with prescription and over-the-counter drugs can be a
bad mix, according to Dr. Karch, who is also the assistant medical
examiner for the city of San Francisco, and other experts.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most popular herbs _ echinacea, ginkgo biloba,
ginseng, St. John's wort and valerian _ can present the most
dangers when combined with other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know of five deaths when a person on a prescribed
blood-thinning medication like Coumadin also took ginkgo,'' Dr.
Karch says. ''The ginkgo works as yet another blood thinner. The
combination can cause internal bleeding. One death was caused when
a person taking daily doses of aspirin also took ginkgo.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginkgo is said to help memory, endurance and, in some men,
erectile dysfunction. Your health can be safeguarded by always
telling your physician what herbal preparations or vitamin
megadoses you may be taking. Unlike prescription drugs, herbal
products are not regulated by the federal government and do not
have to undergo testing to make sure they are safe or that they
work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't be mislead by the word 'natural,''' Dr. Karch says.
''Too many people think natural also means 'non-toxic' and that is
not always the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele L. Trankina, Ph.D., a nutritional consultant and
professor of nutritional physiology at St. Mary's University in San
Antonio, Texas, concurs: ''Don't take ginkgo if you are taking
vitamin E, flax oil or fish oil. Any of those, plus the herb, can
thin your blood too much and lead to internal bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   And that can lead to blindness or stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Echinacea, the top selling herb in the United States, ostensibly
works by bolstering your immune system. But there are many cases in
which the immune system is already far too active.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you have an immune system disorder like arthritis or lupus,
you do not want to stimulate your immune system any more,'' Dr.
Karch says. ''Those diseases are caused by an overactive immune
function.'' Transplant patients _ who must take prescription drugs
to ensure their bodies do not reject the donated organ _ should
also forsake echinacea.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Professor Trankina: ''Echinacea is not meant to be taken
indefinitely. I advise patients to go off it after six weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's wort, sometimes known as the herbal Prozac, is often
taken to relieve depression. However, if you are already taking a
mood elevator, skip the St. John's wort. The two can interact and
led to adverse side affects like mania, extreme fatigue and
incoherency.
</P>
<P>
   A class of prescription medications known as ''psoralens,'' used
to treat some skin diseases like vitiligio and psoriasis, can also
interact with St. John's wort. Taking both can lead to serious
sunburns because both cause sensitivity to sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Kava is a herbal sedative often used for its calming effects and
its ability to relieve anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if you are already taking a prescribed sleeping pill, and
you add in kava, you can easily be over-sedated,'' says Professor
Trankina.
</P>
<P>
   Pass on the kava if you are taking drugs for Parkinson's disease
or antipsychotic medications or if you've had alcoholic drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I advise women to skip ginseng if they are taking estrogen
supplements,'' says Professor Trankina. ''Some forms of ginseng
contain weak forms of estrogen. Too much estrogen promotes the
growth of breast and uterine tumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Valerian is often used as a sleep aid so experts say you should
not take that herb with alcohol, sedatives or sleeping pills.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Trankina advises, ''Of all the popular herbs on the
market, I recommend staying away from at least one: ma huang. It is
basically a herbal form of amphetamine, because it contains a drug
known as ephedra, which has been banned at one time or another.
Most people who take it will be OK, but many will develop a
heartbeat that races so fast, it can actually stop the heart.''
