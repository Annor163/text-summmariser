Jurors in the Robert Blake murder trial went home after a sixth full day of
deliberations without reaching a verdict.
</P>
<P>
By the end of Monday, jurors had put in about 32 1/2 hours of deliberations. The
panel has been discussing the case since March 4, when closing arguments
concluded.

Blake, 71, is accused of killing Bonny Lee Bakley, 44, who was shot to death in
May 2001 in his car near an Italian restaurant.
</P>
<P>
The star of TV's "Baretta" detective series and the movie "In Cold Blood" is
charged with murder, two counts of solicitation of murder, and a special
circumstance of lying in wait. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, jurors reviewed testimony by three people who saw Blake at the
restaurant the night of the killing. It was the only time since deliberations
began that jurors asked the court for information from the trial.
