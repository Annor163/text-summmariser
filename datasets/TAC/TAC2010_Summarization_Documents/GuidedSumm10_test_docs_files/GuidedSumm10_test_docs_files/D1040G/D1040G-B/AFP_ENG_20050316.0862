<P>
Former Hollywood star Robert Blake 
was Wednesday found not guilty of murdering his con-artist wife, who 
was gunned down as she waited outside a restaurant where they had 
just dined.
</P>
<P>
A jury in Los Angeles also found the 71-year-old star of the hit 
1970s television detective series "Baretta" not guilty of 
solicitation to commit the murder of his wife of six months, Bonny 
Lee Bakley in May 2001.
</P>
<P>
The former child star put his head down on the defendant's table 
and sobbed as the Los Angeles jury foreman read out the not guilty 
verdicts after a three-month trial and eight days of deliberation by 
the panel.
</P>
<P>
The jury was however deadlocked 11-to-one over a third count of 
solicitation of murder involving former stuntman Ronald "Duffy" 
Hambleton.
</P>
<P>
Judge Darlene Schempp dismissed the charge, ending Blake's four 
year criminal court odyssey that took him from movie star to murder 
suspect and saw him jailed for a year following his April 2002 
arrest.
</P>
<P>
Jury foreman Thomas Nicholson told reporters there was no 
convincing evidence to convict Blake of the grisly murder. "They 
couldn't put the gun in his hands," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing," he said. explaining that no gun shot 
residue had been found on Blake's hands and no blood on his 
clothing.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had alleged that the actor shot Bakley -- portrayed 
as a star-struck scam artist intent on marrying a celebrity -- in 
the head after two retired stunt doubles refused to do the job for 
him.
</P>
<P>
Bakley was killed as she sat in Blake's parked car alone as he 
returned to a Hollywood restaurant where the couple had just had 
dinner to pick up a handgun he claimed he accidentally left behind 
at their table.
</P>
<P>
Blake claimed that he returned to the car to find his wife 
bleeding profusely from the gunshot wound to her head and shoulder.
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, an angry Blake heaped praise on his 
lawyers and excoriated former friends and acquaintances who spoke 
ill of him to the media. 
</P>
<P>
"Guess what? They're all liars, and about half of them are 
commode scum," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution claimed that Blake wanted the 44-year-old 
convicted scamster dead because he hated her and wanted to get their 
baby daughter out of her clutches.
</P>
<P>
In opening arguments in December, prosecutor Shellie Samuels 
said Blake regarded Bakley as "trailer trash" and became obsessed 
with keeping her and her family away from their daughter, who is now 
four.
</P>
<P>
"The victim in this was killed because the defendant wanted sole 
custody of their child and wanted the baby away from her mother and 
her mother's family," she told jurors.
</P>
<P>
Bakley was portrayed in court as a confidence trickster who made 
her living scamming older male customers through a mail-order sex 
business and attempts to scam celebrities.
</P>
<P>
Blake married Bakley in November 2000 after DNA tests indicated 
he was the father of their daughter. The pair lived separately, with 
Bakley occupying a bungalow on Blake's property.
</P>
<P>
Bakley had initially told Blake the child was fathered by either 
Blake or Christian Brando, the son of the late actor Marlon Brando.
</P>
<P>
The 100 witnesses in the stranger-than-fiction celebrity trial 
included two drug-addled former stuntmen and a street thug and 
part-time actor who claimed to have turned away from crime after 
finding God.
</P>
<P>
But they failed to convince jurors.
</P>
<P>
Bakley's 24-year-old daughter, Holly Gawron, wept in the 
courtroom as the verdict was read.        Blake still faces a 
wrongful-death lawsuit brought by Gawron and Bakley's three other 
children.    Prosecution spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said her office 
believed it had a "solid circumstantial case" against  Blake.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the evidence was compelling," Gibbons said. "We 
presented the evidence to the jury fully, honesty and 
professionally. Unfortunately, these jurors disagreed with our view 
of the evidence."
</P>
<P>
If he had been found guilty, Blake could have faced a life 
sentence.
