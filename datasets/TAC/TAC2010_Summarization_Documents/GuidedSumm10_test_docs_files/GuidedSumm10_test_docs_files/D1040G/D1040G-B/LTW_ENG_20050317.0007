He Has Plenty to Say Afterward

<P>
In the 12-week murder trial, jurors never heard
Robert Blake testify in his own defense.
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, minutes after the jury acquitted him of charges
that he killed his wife, Blake emerged from the Van Nuys courthouse
with plenty to say.
</P>
<P>
Before a battalion of reporters and news cameras, the actor turned
in a performance resembling the Oscar-acceptance speech that he's
never had the opportunity to give during his 60-year acting career.
</P>
<P>
``My whole life is a blessing,'' he said over the roar of new
choppers, ``for all the times I should have been dead or not even
born.''
</P>
<P>
For the better part of half an hour, Blake held forth in unscripted
and defiant jubilation.
</P>
<P>
It was a wandering -- at-times elegant, at times angry --
monologue. Liberally employing 1950s Rat-Pack slang and streetwise
double negatives, Blake conjured the spirit of his best-known role,
the Emmy-winning 1970s television detective, Baretta.
</P>
<P>
The 71-year-old diminutive New Jersey-born actor, nee Mickey
Gubitosi, profusely thanked M. Gerry Schwartzbach, the Mill Valley
lawyer who took the actor's defense early last year after three
previous counselors had quit.
</P>
<P>
``He'll never be rich and he'll never be famous 'cause he don't
know nothing about money,'' Blake said of Schwartzbach, who stood
beaming by his side through the news conference. ``And he has no idea
what to do with you people (in the media), but by God he can save
lives and that'll keep him warm on any cold night of his life. ...
(He) never lost focus. Genius is the ability to discern that which is
important and to act upon it. That's what Einstein said.''
</P>
<P>
Breaking into a Jewish accent, he recounted how Schwartzbach's wife
urged her husband to take the actor's case. At that point, Schwatzbach
turned to Blake and said with a laugh: ``She's not Jewish.''
</P>
<P>
He also thanked Schwartzbach's young attorneys and the private
investigators who ``came in for short dough and long hours to save my
life. ... This small band of dedicated warriors saved my life.''
</P>
<P>
After spending the trial mostly silent, Blake seemed to relish the
opportunity to speak out. At one point, Sheriff's deputies asked
Blake's entourage to wind down the news conference. But he pushed
ahead. Later, he deflected reporter's questions by saying, ``Let me
just run this down then you guys can do whatever you want,'' then
proceeded to speak uninterrupted for several minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
His finances are now in shambles, Blake said.
</P>
<P>
``If you want to know how to go through $10 million in five years,
ask me,'' he said. ``I'm broke. I need a job.''
</P>
<P>
``What did Johnny Cochran say? `You're innocent until proven
broke,''' he said. ``By the time Gerry and his troops got here it was
the bottom of the barrel. I was a rich man. I'm broke now.''
</P>
<P>
Still, Blake waxed wistfully about his future plans.
</P>
<P>
``I'm going to go out and do a little cowboyin'. You know what that
is? Cowboying is getting in a motor home or a van or something like
that and you just let the air blow in your air and you wind up in some
little bar in Arizona someplace. ... You shoot one-handed nine-ball
with some 90-year-old Portuguese woman who beats the hell out of you
and the next day you wind up in a park some place playing chess with
somebody and you go see a high school play where they're doing `West
Side Story.'
</P>
<P>
''You just roam around and get some revitalization that there are
human beings in the world, that there are people living their lives
that have no agenda.``
</P>
<P>
He said he pined for a simpler time, the current one being marbled
with deceit.
</P>
<P>
''You know the Mafia saying, `the enemy of my enemy is my friend.'
This world I've been in, it's very much that way. People drift from
one side to the other every five minutes and you never know who's on
your side and who's not on your side.
</P>
<P>
``In the past four, five years all of you have interviewed a great
many people. You've interviewed friends, you've interviewed producers
that worked for me, distant relatives and close immediate relatives,''
he said. ``Well, guess what, they're all liars, and about half of them
are commode scum.''
</P>
<P>
For two years, Blake wore an electronic monitoring device so that
authorities could keep track of his movements. Blake turned the leg
band into a prop at the end of his news conference.
</P>
<P>
Using film-industry lingo, he asking reporters: ``Any one of you
gaffers got a pair of dykes, cutters? Does any one of you guys have a
tool kit with a pair of cutters?''
</P>
<P>
When wire cutters were passed to him, he cut off the electronic
monitor that had been around his ankle since he was released on $1.5
million bail in 2003, after spending 11 months in jail.
</P>
<P>
Schwartzbach held it up for all to see.
