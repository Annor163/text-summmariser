<HEADLINE> Former Indonesian President Fails to Appear for Questioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Indonesian President
Soeharto failed to appear on Monday for questioning by the
Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers representing the 78-year-old former president told
reporters that their client was too sick to answer the summons.
</P>
<P>
The Attorney General's Office last Thursday announced that it
would summon Soeharto on Monday for further investigation on
alleged corruption.
</P>
<P>
Since Soeharto stepped down from the presidency in May 1998,
there has been a public outcry, demanding that he be put on trial
for alleged corruption during his rule.
</P>
<P>
Last year, investigation into Soeharto was ceased by the then
Acting Attorney General Ismudjoko due to "lack of evidences."
</P>
<P>
The move, however, triggered anger from many parties nationwide
who believed that Soeharto was responsible for rampant corruption
in the country during his 32-year rule.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent Attorney General Marzuki Darusman decided in
December last year to reopen the Soeharto case, saying his office
had found new evidences.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who has repeatedly denied allegations that he amassed
a fortune during his reign, was hospitalized twice last year after
suffering a stroke and intestinal bleeding.
