<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Instructs Attorney General to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie has instructed Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib to take
active and effective actions in fighting corruption, collusion and
nepotism and to take legal measures against former president
Soeharto soon.
</P>
<P>
"The Attorney General should soon take legal measures against
Soeharto for alleged practices of corruption, collusion and
nepotism, based on the presumption of innocence and respect for
human rights," State Secretary/Minister Akbar Tanjung said
Thursday after accompanying the head of state at a consultative
meeting with legislators.
</P>
<P>
He said the complete instruction is stipulated in Presidential
Instruction No. 30/1998 on the eradication of corruption,
collusion and nepotism in an effort to accelerate the
implementation of national development.
</P>
<P>
The instruction implements People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)
Decree No. 11/MPR/1998 which was passed by a special MPR session
on November 13, he added.
</P>
<P>
Article 4 of the MPR decree states that efforts to eradicate
corruption, collusion and nepotism must be made indiscriminately
upon any state officials, former state officials, their families
and cronies as well as private businessmen, business tycoons and
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung noted that Habibie has long given the instruction to
the Attorney General during cabinet meetings.
</P>
<P>
Early investigations, he said, show that Soeharto led seven
foundations with total assets of 4.1 trillion rupiah (585 million
U.S. dollars) and has 23 billion rupiah (3.28 million U.S.
dollars) deposited in 72 banks -- 57 private banks, 7 state banks
and 8 foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
"With Presidential Instruction No. 30/1998, the Attorney
General would be more active in conducting the investigation of
Soeharto," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Justice Minister Muladi said the government has
decided to use government bodies, such as the Attorney General's
Office, in efforts to combat corrupt, collusive and nepotistic
practices and investigate Soeharto's alleged hidden wealth.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, the government said it will form an
independent commission that would investigate Soeharto's personal
fortune.
</P>
<P>
The idea has drawn pros and cons from the people, Muladi said.
</P>
<P>
However, if it is necessary, the government will set up an
independent commission, he said, adding that a decree on this has
been drafted and commission members are being chosen.
</P>
<P>
"The decree is already with President Habibie but he has not
yet signed it," Muladi added.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to step down on May 21 amid the country's
worst political and economic crisis in decades. He is accused of
corruption and abuse of power during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
Students and citizens in the country have held various
demonstrations, urging the government to bring Soeharto to court
on charges of corruption, collusion and nepotism.
