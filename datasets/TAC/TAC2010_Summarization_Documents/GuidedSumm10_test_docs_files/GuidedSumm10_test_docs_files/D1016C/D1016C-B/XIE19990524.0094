<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Urges Study on Soeharto Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Monday instructed Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib to study
intensively all the data provided by the U.S. Time magazine on the
alleged wealth of former President Soeharto and his family abroad.
</P>
<P>
"But (the investigation on former President Soeharto's
allegedly hidden wealth) should abide by the concept of (respect
for) human rights," State Secretary/Justice Minister Muladi quoted
Habibie as saying after a meeting with Ghalib, Defense Minister
Gen. Wiranto and himself at the Merdeka Palace here.
</P>
<P>
Muladi said Ghalib has also been asked to investigate the
magazine's findings, considering that Soeharto had authorized him
to do so.
</P>
<P>
He said that during their meeting, Ghalib reported to the
president that he has sent a letter to the ambassadors of
Switzerland, Austria and the United States to Indonesia as well as
Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas to provide data on the wealth
of the former president, based on the Time report.
</P>
<P>
Time reported that the Soeharto family amassed a 15 billion
U.S. dollar fortune during his 32 years of rule.
</P>
<P>
The Soehartos' fortune includes 9 billion dollars in cash that
was transferred from a bank in Switzerland to another bank in
Austria shortly after the former ruler was forced from office in
May last year, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
"(We need) data such as proof of the transfer (of Soeharto
funds from a Swiss bank to an Austrian bank). Time did mention the
data, but it would be much better if there is evidence of the
transfer. This is not easy to be obtained if we do not get
assistance from the governments of Switzerland, Austria and the
U.S.," Muladi added.
</P>
<P>
Muladi said the Attorney General's Office has set up a team
tasked to look into the Time report.
</P>
<P>
The probe into Soeharto's alleged ill-gotten wealth will be
completed after the June 7 general election.
</P>
<P>
"This is the government's commitment," he said.
</P>
<P>
If Time magazine has the will to help settle the case, it is
not difficult for it to send its data on Soeharto's alleged wealth
stashed abroad, he added.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto asserted in a recent private television interview that
he did not own a single cent in foreign banks and he challenged
the government and the general public to trace whatever wealth he
possesses overseas.
