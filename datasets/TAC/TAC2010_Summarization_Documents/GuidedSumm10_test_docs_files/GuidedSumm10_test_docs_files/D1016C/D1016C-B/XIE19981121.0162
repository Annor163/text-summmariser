<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Wealth Probe Must End by 2000: Legislators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The three main factions in
Indonesia's House of Representatives (DPR) have agreed that an
official investigation into the wealth of former president
Soeharto must be launched immediately and concluded before the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
According to the Indonesian Observer Saturday, the ruling
Golkar (Functional Group), the Armed Forces (ABRI) and the United
Development Party (PPP) said the government need not wait for a
special law to probe Soeharto's riches.
</P>
<P>
The fourth House faction, the government-backed Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI), had no comment.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Golkar faction Andi Mattalatta said President
B.J. Habibie's administration must be able to finish the wealth
probe before it gets replaced by a more legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
The next plenary meeting of the People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR), which will comprise new legislators, is scheduled to take
place in December 1999 to elect new president and vice president.
</P>
<P>
Mattalatta said the wealth probe should commence immediately
because existing laws on corruption in the criminal code are
sufficient for justice to be served.
</P>
<P>
Aisyah Amini of the PPP faction endorsed the argument, saying
the government will be able to refer to existing laws when
conducting the wealth probe.
</P>
<P>
"It depends on the intensive steps taken by the government. The
House will only monitor its actions," Amini added.
</P>
<P>
Acmad Roestandi of the ABRI faction likewise demanded a quick
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after attending a prayer session Friday,
House Speaker Harmoko said he had already called on the government
to launch the wealth probe.
</P>
<P>
"As House Speaker, I have said the investigation must not
proceed slowly," he said, adding the House must issue a new law as
the legal basis for a wealth probe.
</P>
<P>
Habibie is facing mounting public pressure to force Soeharto
and his family to account for the fortune they allegedly amassed
through corruption over the past 32 years.
</P>
<P>
Habibie has already launched an investigation into Soeharto's
wealth. An official at the Attorney General's Office Friday said
Soeharto has 2.3 million U.S. dollars in 72 domestic banks. Some
estimates have put Soeharto's wealth at 40 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has denied having any money stashed overseas.
</P>
<P>
Critics claim the government and the Attorney General's Office
are deliberately stalling efforts to recover the Soeharto fortune.
Thousands of students Thursday marched in Central Jakarta,
demanding that Soeharto be put on trial for alleged corruption and
power abuse.
</P>
<P>
The fight against corruption in Indonesia should begin by
bringing "the big fish" to court, said Mar'ie Muhammad, chairman
of the Indonesian Society for Transparency, Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We should begin with the big fish to set an example. We should
start by establishing whether or how Soeharto abused his power to
enrich his family and cronies," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Soeharto Friday went fishing at the
Thousand Islands north of Jakarta, leaving Jakarta for the first
time since his downfall on May 21.
