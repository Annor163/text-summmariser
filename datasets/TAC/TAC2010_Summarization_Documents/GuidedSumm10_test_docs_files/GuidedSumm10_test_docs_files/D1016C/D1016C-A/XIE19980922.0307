JAKARTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General
Andi M. Ghalib Monday said he would ask former President Soeharto
to sign a letter of authorization that would enable the
investigation team to probe Soeharto's overseas wealth.
</P>
<P>
"With this letter of authorization, I can go anywhere in the
world to search accounts that may be held by Soeharto," Ghalib was
quoted by the newspaper The Indonesian Observer Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Without such a letter, it will be hard for the team to ask
foreign banks to open their records due to long-established
banking secrecy policies, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has set up two teams to investigate
alleged corruption by Soeharto as well as his wealth.
</P>
<P>
A team of investigators will soon question Soeharto, Ghalib
said without mentioning time and place for the questioning.
</P>
<P>
Local and foreign reports have accused Soeharto of amassing
wealth illegally during his 32-year reign and stashing the fortune
overseas.
</P>
<P>
But Soeharto, who stepped down amid mounting public pressure on
May 21, swore that he did not have any deposits abroad in a
statement broadcast by his own daughter's television station early
this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Secretary/Minister Akbar Tanjung Monday
reiterated the government's seriousness in investigating
Soeharto's wealth.
</P>
<P>
"The government is serious in investigating Soeharto's personal
fortune. Should there be indications (that this wealth was amassed
illegally), the government will pursue the case and take legal
action," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the special team tasked to investigate the former
president has already scheduled a meeting with Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, Soeharto will receive the team soon," Tanjung said.
