<HEADLINE> Indonesian Assembly Agrees to Probe Soeharto's Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- In an apparent response to
mounting demands from students and opposition groups, Indonesian
legislators on Friday agreed to launch an investigation into
former president Soeharto's wealth.
</P>
<P>
All five factions of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR),
the country's highest legislative body, agreed to add a provision
in a decree on clean governance, preventing centralization of
power, corruption, collusion and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
Article four of the decree states that efforts to eradicate
corruption, collusion and nepotism must be made indiscriminately
upon any state officials, former state officials, their families
and cronies as well as private businessmen, business tycoons and
former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
After an uncertain response to wide calls for a thorough
investigation into the wealth of Soeharto, his family and friends,
the dominant Golkar (Functional Group) faction has finally changed
its position, saying that it strongly supports the wealth probe.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a plenary meeting on Wednesday, Golkar spokesperson
Marwah Daud Ibrahim said the implementation of a clean government,
with no traces of corruption, collusion and nepotism, is a
prerequisite to achievement of the aims of the 1945 proclamation.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Golkar officially declared war against
corruption, collusion and nepotism. During the 32 year rule of
Soeharto, Golkar had been in the government bandwagon, given an
amen to virtually all the regime's policies and whims.
</P>
<P>
However, Golkar voiced objections to proposals that the special
MPR session adopt a special decree to investigate Soeharto's
wealth. It said it would be more relevant if the call for the
probe into the riches of the former president and his family was
made part of the decree on corruption, collusion and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
The United Development Party faction earlier asked for a
separate decree to contain investigation into Soeharto, officials,
former officials and their families.
</P>
<P>
The faction's spokesman Djuhad Mahja told reporters that they
finally agreed with the decree on anti-corruption, collusion and
nepotism because the faction's proposal had been accommodated in
it.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the stand of the Golkar on the subject, the
Jakarta Post said, "This is another display of their halfhearted
commitment to clean up corruption. A clause in a decree can easily
be ignored, but a specific decree would give the needed impetus to
kick start the investigation."
