MOUNT ST. HELENS CALMER AFTER A BELCH OF STEAM AND ASH
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the fifth straight day, Mount St. Helens let out a burst of steam
and ash on Tuesday, similar to the earlier bursts that have risen out
of the crater and perhaps larger.
</P>
<P>
But with that exhalation, it suddenly dozed off, and earthquakes that
have shaken the area almost continually for two weeks stopped almost
entirely.
</P>
<P>
"The seismicity dropped off quite dramatically," said Steve Malone,
director of the seismology lab at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
The earthquakes began Sept. 23, when Mount St. Helens began to
revive, and gradually increased in intensity and pace, culminating in
an eruption a cloud of steam and ash on Friday, the first eruption
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
The earthquakes tailed off briefly, but returned in an hour or two
and became stronger. On Saturday, at the peak of seismic unrest,
three to four quakes a minute shook St. Helens, with the larger ones,
between magnitude 2 and magnitude 3, occurring every couple of
minutes.
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's steam burst, the larger earthquakes ceased
completely, and the smaller ones, almost all smaller than magnitude
1, slowed to a pace of one per minute or two.
</P>
<P>
William Steele, another seismologist at the University of Washington,
said, "That is an indication perhaps that it's running out of energy.
Maybe it's accomplished what it's going to do."
</P>
<P>
So far, Mount St. Helens has done relatively little compared to the
months leading up to its cataclysmic 1980 eruption. Then, a large
bulge formed on the volcano's northern flank, rising five feet a day.
By May 18, 1980, the bulge had been pushed upward and outward by more
than 450 feet when a magnitude-5.1 earthquake hit, and the bulge
collapsed in a landslide. That, in effect, took the lid off the magma
underground, and later that day, Mount St. Helens erupted
explosively.
</P>
<P>
This time, global positioning system sensors detect no movement on
the volcano's outer flanks. The only deformation is within St.
Helens' mile-wide crater, on the southern side of a lava dome that
built up during smaller eruptions from 1980-86. Over the last two
weeks, that part of the dome has cracked as it has been lifted about
100 feet.
</P>
<P>
Infrared images have shown spots on the dome that are 35 to 70
degrees warmer than surrounding rock, said Jacob B. Lowenstern of the
U.S. Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
The steam eruptions have emanated from beneath a horseshoe-shaped
glacier that wraps around the lava dome. The steam has melted a pond
about 100 feet wide, the waters roiling with bubbles of hot volcanic
gases rising from the magma.
</P>
<P>
Lowenstern said he doubted that the lull in earthquakes signaled the
end of the current episode.
</P>
<P>
"The magma is still coming up," he said. "It would seem very unlikely
that it would just stop. I think we expect more of the kinds of
explosions that we've seen over the last few days, and it wouldn't be
surprising to see more evidence of magma reaching the surface."
