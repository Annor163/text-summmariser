Brain tissue samples from a 
suspected US beef cow began its trip to England on Thursday for 
final tests to confirm if it is the second case of mad cow disease
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
An Agriculture Department official is carrying the samples to 
the internationally recognized laboratory in Weybridge, England. 
The laboratory confirmed the so far only US case of mad cow 
disease in December 2003.

"When we have all of the final results, we will share them very
publicly," said Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns in a statement 
Thursday. The test results are expected to come out in about a 
week.
</P>
<P>
The department announced the suspected case on June 10. The 
possible new case is one of the three suspected animals that were 
previously tested negative for mad cow disease. They were tested 
again with a different technology at the request of the USDA's 
Inspector General who was reviewing the department's mad cow 
testing program. And the results showed one animal tested positive.

<P>
Johanns has said the meat of the suspected animal did not enter
the food or feed chain.
</P>
<P>
Some published reports say the suspected beef cow was found in 
Texas, far away from Washington state, where the only US proven 
case of mad cow disease was reported.
</P>
<P>
People eating animal meat products contaminated with mad cow 
disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), can develop a 
human variant of the fatal brain-wasting disease, called 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The brain disorder has killed more than
150 people, mostly in Britain, where an outbreak was reported in 
the 1990s.
