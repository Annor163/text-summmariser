A new case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow

the country to 20 since the first appearance of the disease in 2000.

Spain's Agriculture and Fishery Ministry said Tuesday that the case
was confirmed by the Zaragoza and Algete laboratories in Madrid.

The infected animal, a seven-year-old cow on a farm near the
Ciudadela city on the Balearic islands, has died, said the ministry.

As a preventive measure, the government ordered slaughter of all the
157 animals on that farm and their offspring with the same age as the
infected cow.

The carcasses of the cows will be incinerated and the owner will
receive compensation.
