Goat confirmed with 'mad cow' disease in France in first case 
ever

<DATELINE>
PARIS, Jan 28
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A French goat slaughtered in 2002 has 
tested positive for "mad cow" disease, the French agriculture 
ministry said Friday, in what is the first known case in the world 
of the fatal illness in an animal other than a bovine.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the disease -- known scientifically as bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) -- is a disturbing sign that it can 
be transmitted to other species used for human consumption.
</P>
<P>
BSE has been linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), 
the human form of mad cow disease, which causes brain-wasting, 
personality change, loss of body function, and ultimately death.
