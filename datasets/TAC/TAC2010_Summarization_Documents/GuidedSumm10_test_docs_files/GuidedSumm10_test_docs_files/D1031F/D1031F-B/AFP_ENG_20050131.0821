<P>
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said 
Tuesday it had cancelled a bio-diversity project with Bangladesh due 
to failure to meet conditions for the project loan.
</P>
<P>
The bank had approved a 37-million-dollar loan for a 
conservation project in the Sundarbans forest in 1998 but during 
implementation, the project "encountered difficulties with design 
and financial management.
</P>
<P>
"With about three quarters of the loan period elapsed, only 
about one quarter of the project had been implemented as of 
end-December 2004 and only one quarter of the funds had been 
disbursed," the ADB said in a statement from its headquarters in the 
Philippine capital.
</P>
<P>
Following an ADB mission in October, the bank decided to cancel 
the balance of the loan, amounting to about 25 million dollars, and 
at the request of the government, reallocated it to an emergency 
flood damage rehabilitation project.
</P>
<P>
The original project was intended to develop a sustainable 
conservation system for the Sundarbans, part of the world's largest 
remaining contiguous mangrove area, and reduce poverty of the 3.5 
million people living around the forest.
