coast

<P>
As the people of 
Indonesia's Aceh province try to rebuild lives shattered by the 
tsunami disaster, officials are also assessing the environmental 
damage to the coast which bore the brunt of the giant waves.
</P>
<P>
The tsunami unleashed on December 26 by a magnitude-9.0 
earthquake off Sumatra island, which includes Aceh, left about 
230,000 people missing or dead in the province.
</P>
<P>
Besides the untold human misery, officials say the quake and 
giant waves wrought havoc on the marine ecosystem, tearing up coral 
reefs and wiping out mangrove forests and seaweed beds along the 
coast.
</P>
<P>
Government experts and United Nations officials say it could 
take years and hundreds of million of dollars to restore the 
environmental damage to these backbones of the marine ecosystem 
caused by the natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
The UN Environmental Programme said the quake and the waves had 
damaged 25,000 hectares (61,750 acres) of mangroves, some 29,200 
hectares of coral reefs and 120 hectares of seagrass beds.
</P>
<P>
The UN agency last week sent an expert to Aceh to address the 
environmental impact of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Other teams are investigating the damage in the 10 other 
affected Indian Ocean countries.
</P>
<P>
Three teams from the Indonesian fisheries ministry are also in 
the region to determine what can be done to revive the fishuaculture Development Center at Ujong Batee Point east of the 
provincial capital Banda Aceh lost most of its staff to the killer 
waves.
</P>
<P>
The assessment teams would also try to determine whether the 
damaged coast was still fit for fish culture, he added.
</P>
<P>
Environment Minister Rachmat Witular told the regional newspaper 
Serambi in an interview that it would take four years to restore the 
coastal environment to its pre-tsunami condition.
</P>
<P>
UNEP official Ben Claesen, who arrived in Banda Aceh last week, 
told AFP his team was still in the process of drawing up a more 
in-depth report on the destruction.
</P>
<P>
Replanting mangrove swamps which enveloped 1,625 kilometres 
(1,000 miles) of the north Sumatran coast until they were 
obliterated by the tsunami would be the first priority, Muhammad 
Adli Abdullah, an Indonesian consultant of the UN Development 
Programme, told AFP. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a mangrove replanting to make the fish 
sanctuaries recover," he said, suggesting the UN or other aid 
agencies pay the more than half a million fishermen now out of work 
to restore the mangrove swamps.
</P>
<P>
"If we cannot there will be a big problem for the fishing 
community" of about 600,000 people, Adli said.
</P>
<P>
He said it would take two years "but we should start now".
</P>
<P>
The government also needed short-term measures to help feed the 
affected fishing community because of the tsunami's impact on their 
livelihood, he said.
</P>
<P>
While people could help restore the mangroves, there is little 
that can be done about the damage to the slow-growing coral reefs 
that are also important sanctuaries for fish and other marine 
creatures.
</P>
<P>
On the nearby island of Simeulue, officials said coral reefs had 
been pushed up above the water off the north coast, which had risen 
by more than a meter (three feet) due to the shift in tectonic 
plates caused by the quake.
</P>
<P>
Although there was some contamination of the waters by motor oil 
from vehicles and chemicals carried off to sea by the waves, experts 
said the damage was limited as Aceh and North Sumatra provinces are 
not very industrialised.
