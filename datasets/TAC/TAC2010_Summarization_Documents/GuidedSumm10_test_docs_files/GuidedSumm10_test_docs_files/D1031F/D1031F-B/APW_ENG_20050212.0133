Indonesia is considering plans to restrict construction along some coastlines in
tsunami-hit Aceh province, while planting mangrove forests to act as a natural
barrier against high surf, newspapers said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The draft plan, released Friday during a government Cabinet meeting in Aceh,
calls for tsunami-stricken areas to be divided into three redevelopment zones.
Thick mangrove forests, which once covered wide swathes of Sumatra Island, would
be planted in the hardest-hit towns, including Meulaboh, Calang and the
provincial capital Banda Aceh, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, minister for national
development planning, was quoted as saying in The Jakarta Post.

Flood walls will be added if necessary and roads linking inland areas to the
coast will be rebuilt, it said.
</P>
<P>
Residents whose coastal homes or businesses were swept away in the tsunami will
be asked to rebuild away from the shore to create a buffer zone, Sri said. It
was unclear how wide the buffer zone would be.
</P>
<P>
In moderately damaged areas farther inland, authorities would limit homes and
other development _ such as farms, fisheries and city gardens _ while no
restrictions would apply in the least damaged areas, according to the Post.
Koran Tempo newspaper carried a similar report.

<P>
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has asked that the master plan be finalized
by the end of March. Input is now being gathered from villagers and businesses,
it said.

<P>
Killer waves pounded the area Dec. 26 following a magnitude-9.0 earthquake that
struck off the coast of Sumatra Island. More than 117,000 people died, and
rescue workers are continuing to recover hundreds of corpses still buried under
mounds of rubble.

<P>
The tsunami hit 10 other Indian Ocean countries, killing more than 164,000
people overall.
