<HEADLINE> Yemen Condemns U.S. Attack on Sudanese Facility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh condemned the U.S. air raid on a Sudanese facility as a
violation of international laws and conventions.
</P>
<P>
Saleh was quoted by the Yemeni News Agency as saying that the
U.S. attack would jeopardize the regional security and stability.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the necessity of "pursuing facts and using dialog
instead of power and threats" in solving international disputes.
</P>
<P>
He accused of the U.S. military actions of violating human
rights.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched missile attacks Thursday night on a
pharmaceutical factory near the Sudanese capital Khartoum in
retaliation for the bombings on August 7 against its embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
It also fired cruise missiles at suspected terrorist bases in
eastern Afghanistan, killing scores of people.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been accusing Sudan of sponsoring international
terrorism. It justified its attack on Sudan on its assessment that
the destroyed factory was manufacturing chemical weapons, which
could be used by terrorists to attacks U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
Saleh expressed sympathy for the victims in the strikes.
</P>
<P>
Ten people are being treated for injuries in Khartoum
hospitals, and it was feared that more victims could be buried in
the rubble.
