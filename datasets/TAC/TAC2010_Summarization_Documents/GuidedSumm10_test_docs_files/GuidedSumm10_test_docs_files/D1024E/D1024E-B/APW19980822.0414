	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Whipping up popular anger over a U.S.
missile strike, President Omar el-Bashir said Saturday that
Sudanese were prepared to die in a holy war.
	   ``America is attacking us because we are guardians of Islam,''
el-Bashir told a central Khartoum rally of at least 5,000 people,
who replied with chants of ``Death to America.''
	   ``We have tasted the sweet flavor of Jihad (holy war) and
matyrdom and what we seek now is to die for the sake of God,''
el-Bashir said.
	   ``Go! Go! We are behind you,'' responded the crowd, which
included Cabinet ministers, members of parliament, trade unionists
and students who were given the day off to attend the rally outside
the presidential offices.
	   After his speech, some 500 hundred protesters went to the
British Embassy where they hurled stones at the building. One
demonstrator climbed to the top of the embassy flagpole and cut
down the Union Jack.
	   After the flag fell to the ground, angry demonstrators tore it
to pieces.
	   Khartoum newspapers have published that British Prime Minister
Tony Blair has expressed support for the U.S. attack on a factory
in north Khartoum on Thursday. Washington says the factory produced
the ingredients of chemical weapons, while Khartoum says it
manufactured only pharmaceutical products.
	   One person was killed in the attack and nine others wounded.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the cruise missile strike in
retaliation for the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi,
Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7. U.S. missiles also
struck the Afghanistan camps of Muslim militant Osama bin Laden,
the man whom Washington accuses of instigating the embassy
bombings.
	   Sudan's government, beleaguered by economic failure and 15 years
of war against southern insurgents, has sought to use the strikes
to rally support.
	   Another speaker at the rally launched a scathing attack on
America's allies in the Middle East, such as Israel and Egypt.
	   ``America's Arab friends and the head of the snake, Israel, are
deceiving Clinton and the Americans into becoming enemies of
Muslims,'' said the head of the Sudanese Students' Federation,
Hamdi Hassan.
	   ``The Israelis want to maintain the upper hand in a region that
is predominantly Arab and Muslim,'' Hassan said.
	   One banner at the rally hit on a theme sounded time and again by
Sudanese: President Clinton launched the attack to draw attention
from his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern.
	   It said: ``No war for Monica.''
	   Sudan has asked the U.N. Security Council to convene an urgent
meeting to consider a U.N. investigation into the factory's
production and the attack. Sudanese diplomats are to address an
emergency meeting of the Arab League in Cairo on Monday.
