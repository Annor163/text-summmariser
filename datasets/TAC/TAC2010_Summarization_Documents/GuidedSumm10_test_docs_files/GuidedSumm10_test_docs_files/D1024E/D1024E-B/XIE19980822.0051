<HEADLINE> Sudan Recalls Diplomats in Washington to Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Sudan decided Friday to recall
its diplomats in Washington to protest the U.S. air raid on a
pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After a cabinet meeting chaired by Sudanese President Omar
Hassan al-Bashir, Minister of Culture and Information Ghazi Saleh
el-Din said the government has also decided to file compliants
with the United Nations, the Arab League and other international
organizations over the U.S. attack.
</P>
<P>
The country's International Civil Aviation Authority will
adopt measures to prevent U.S. aircrafts from flying over the
Sudanese airspace to preserve its national security, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched a missile attack on the pharmaceutical
factory in retaliation for the bombings on August 7 of
its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Washington, which has been accusing Khartoum of sponsoring
international terrorism, alleged that the factory was
manufacturing chemical weapons that could be used by Islamic
militants to attack U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
But Sudanese officials said on Friday that Sudan could prove
that the factory is only for producing medicines and not
chemical weapons as claimed by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Sudanese media reports said the factory, which opened in 1996,
produced about half of the country's medicines, mainly antibiotics
and drugs to treat malaria and tuberculosis.
