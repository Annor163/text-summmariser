<HEADLINE> Sudan Urges International Society to Condemn U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Sudan on Friday called
the U.S. military strikes as "flagrant violation to its
sovereignty and territorial integrity and urged the international
community to condemn the aggression.
</P>
<P>
A statement from Sudan's mission to the United Nations said the
United States launched a missile attack on "El-shifa
Pharmaceutical Factory" in Khartoum under the pretext that the
said factory produces chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the destroyed factory produces
pharmaceutical products and is a joint venture between Sudanese
private sector and some foreign investors including the Economic
Community for Central and Southern African States which main
objective is economic cooperation and integration between member
states for the benefit of their people.
</P>
<P>
It said the U.S. aggression resulted in the total destruction
of the factory, and the death of a large number of citizens and a
number of injuries.
</P>
<P>
Sudan said the aggression is also a glaring breach to the
principles and intents of the United Nations Charter, and the U.S.
justification of being measures of self-defense is baseless,
illogical and naive.
</P>
<P>
While reiterating its consistent stance of condemning all forms
of terrorism, Sudan deplored forcefully the aggression and called
on all member states, regional and international organizations to
condemn it.
