	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir launched a
diplomatic offensive Friday to protest the U.S. missile strike on a
factory in the Sudanese capital.
	   After an emergency meeting with his Cabinet, el-Bashir said
Sudan would file complaints with the United Nations, the Arab
League and the Organization of African Unity.
	   He said Sudan could ``prove that the factory is specifically for
pharmaceutical production'' and not the chemical weapons facility
described by U.S. officials.
	   El-Bashir later spoke at a rally outside his office. Sudanese
who poured to the rally from Friday prayers at the city's mosques
chanted ``Down, Down USA!'' and burned an American flag.
	   The final casualty toll in the missile strike remained unclear.
	   Khartoum Hospital officials said 10 people were being treated
for injuries, including four in critical condition.
	   Workers at the site said there was still concern that some
victims could be buried under the rubble. They told The Associated
Press that the factory's janitor and his family still hadn't been
accounted for.
	   Sidahmed Hajj Hamad, administrative director at the factory,
estimated the damage at dlrs 100 million.
	   Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in
retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the American embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania. U.S. missiles also struck suspected camps of
Muslim militant Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.
	   El-Bashir said that the factory _ the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. in the North Khartoum neighborhood _ was hit by six
Tomahawk missiles.
	   He said a seventh fell short of the target but did not indicate
if it did any damage.
	   At the factory, enveloped in a white haze caused by smoldering
fires, brown glass jars sat in piles amid bricks and twisted sheet
metal. Soldiers and civil defense workers in surgical masks milled
around the site. A white box for latex gloves and blue cartons for
anti-biotics were piled next to the building.
	   There was little security late Friday and visitors were allowed
to enter the deserted factory unhindered.
	   Earlier in the day, a young woman who worked at the factory had
asked The AP: ``Are these people crazy? Do you think this is really
a weapons factory?''
	   State-run Sudan television said the factory, which opened in
1996, produced about half of the country's medicines. Its main
products were reported to be antibiotics and drugs to treat malaria
and tuberculosis.
	   Sudan continued to charge that Clinton took the action to divert
public attention from the grand jury investigation into his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   A statement issued by the Sudanese Embassy in the Kenyan capital
Nairobi said that ``the timing was chosen to serve the wish of a
sexual pervert and maniac to divert attention away from his
crumbling credibility and reputation.''
	   The podium at the rally el-Bashir addressed was decorated with
pictures of Clinton and Lewinsky and bore the slogan ``Clinton:
Screw Monica, not Sudan.''
	   El-Bashir said that ``Clinton and America will have to pay. ...
Sudan is for Islam, and we will not be bullied by Americans.''
	   He pledged to ``pursue all diplomatic channels'' over the
missile attack but also said the government was ``opening all
training camps'' for volunteers for the national militia.
	   Overnight, Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty U.S. Embassy
compound in Khartoum and pulled down the American flag to protest
the attack.
	   The State Department ordered local staff to leave the U.S.
Embassy after the bombings of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar
es-Salaam two weeks ago. American diplomats were pulled out of
Khartoum in 1996.
