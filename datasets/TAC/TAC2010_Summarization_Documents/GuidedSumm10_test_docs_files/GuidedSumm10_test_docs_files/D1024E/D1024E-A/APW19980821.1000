	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Sudan will ask the Security Council to
consider authorizing a U.N. investigation into the U.S. airstrikes
on a Khartoum factory, Sudan's ambassador said Friday, calling the
attack a breach of international law.
	   Ambassador Elfatih Mohamed Ahmed Erwa said he would deliver a
letter of formal complaint requesting the investigation later
Friday to the council president, Danilo Turk of Slovenia. The
letter was from Sudan's foreign minister, Erwa said.
	   The Arab Group of states would support Sudan's request for an
investigation, said Ali Sulaiman R. al-Saeid, the deputy ambassador
of Kuwait.
	   The group, chaired by Kuwait, met Friday to discuss Sudan's
options.
	   Non-aligned states were also meeting Friday and Sudan hoped they
would support the investigation as well, Erwa said in an interview
with The Associated Press.
	   U.S. forces carried out the strikes in retaliation for the
bombings at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, which killed over 250 people.
	   In a statement, Sudan's mission said ``the aggression is a
flagrant violation to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Sudan,'' that violated Article 2 of the U.N. charter, which says
member states must refrain from using force against other states.
	   U.S. officials have said the cruise missile attack on the
Khartoum factory was designed to wipe out a terrorist chemical
plant linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials accuse in the
embassy bombings.
	   Erwa told the Arab Group on Friday that the factory was a
pharmaceutical plant that had no links to bin Laden.
	   The United Nations confirmed Friday that it had contracted the
el-Shifa plant to supply 100,000 liters of veterinary
pharmaceuticals for Iraq under the oil-for-food program. The
pharmaceuticals haven't been delivered, U.N. officials said.
	   Sudan's efforts to rally an investigation came as Pakistan
criticized Washington for acting unilaterally on what it described
as an international problem.
	   ``The problem here is not the right of self-defense. It is how
the scourge of terrorism can best be eliminated from the world,''
said Pakistan's U.N. ambassador, Ahmad Kamal. ``And that requires
an international consensus and that requires all of us sitting on
the same side of the table.''
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson defended the air strikes in a
letter Thursday to Turk that said the moves complied with the
rights of states to self-defense as enshrined in the U.N. charter
and international law.
	   Repeated threats by Bin Laden's terrorist organization left
Washington ``no choice but to use armed force to prevent these
attacks from continuing,'' Richardson wrote.
	   He cited Article 51 of the U.N. charter, which states that
nothing ``shall impair the inherent right of individual or
collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member
of the United Nations.''
	   China's U.N. ambassador, Shen Guofang, said Beijing was waiting
for more information before deciding whether the United States had
violated any U.N. norms.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke to U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright about the raids Thursday by phone from Mali,
where Annan is vacationing, Eckhard said.
	   Annan repeated his condemnation of terrorism and said the
attacks on the U.S. embassies ``illustrate the need for the
international community to come together to combat this menace,''
Eckhard said.
