	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman
Ismail asked the United States on Friday to send a fact-finding
committee to inspect the alleged chemical weapons factory in
Khartoum.
	   The foreign minister spoke to reporters after arriving in
Baghdad a day after U.S. missiles devastated a factory in the
Sudanese capital. The United States said the plant produced the
ingredients of chemical weapons. Sudan said it produced
pharmaceutical products.
	   ``We, as Sudanese, are ready to receive a specialized committee
from the American administration to come and freely investigate
whether this factory ... has anything to do with chemical
(weapons),'' Ismail said.
	   Such a committee could also check whether the factory was owned
by Osama Bin Laden, the Afghanistan-based extremist whom the
Americans have blamed for the bombings of its embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania on Aug. 7, the foreign minister said.
	   If the Americans proved the factory was producing chemical
agents, ``we will accept the attempt (attack),'' Ismail added.
	   Addressing the same press conference, Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf condemned Thursday's attack on the north
Khartoum factory, in which hospital officials say 10 people were
injured.
	   The attack in Khartoum and the simultaneous strike on Bin
Laden's camps in Afghanistan were a ``totally unwarranted act of
aggression,'' al-Sahhaf said.
	   ``They (the Americans) are behaving like international
mercenaries.''
	   Ismail, who is making a three-day visit to Iraq, crossed into
the country from Jordan. U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 ban flights to and from Iraq.
