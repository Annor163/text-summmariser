Two former chiefs of South Korea's intelligence agency were indicted Friday on
charges of supervising illegal mobile phone taps of the country's business and
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
Lim Dong-won and Shin Gunn, who headed the National Intelligence Service
successively between December 1999 and April 2003, are suspected of overseeing
the agency's monitoring of mobile phone conversations of about 1,800 of South
Korea's political, corporate and media elite, the Seoul District Prosecutors'
Office said.
</P>
<P>
Lim, 71, and Shin, 64, have been in custody after being arrested last month.
Both men have denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
The wiretapping scandal began in July following revelations of an alleged 1997
conversation between Hong Seok-hyun, then publisher of the mass-circulation
JoongAng Ilbo newspaper, and Lee Hak-soo, a top executive with Samsung Group,
the country's largest industrial conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
In the conversation, the two purportedly discussed providing illicit campaign
funds to candidates in the 1997 presidential race, won by former dissident Kim
Dae-jung. Lim and Shin headed the agency under Kim, who ordered an end to
wiretaps and has denied knowledge of the practice during his
administration.
</P>
<P>
Hong, a brother-in-law of Samsung Chairman Lee Kun-hee, resigned as South
Korea's ambassador to the United States in September over the scandal. Hong
appeared before prosecutors for questioning last month.
</P>
<P>
Both the spy agency and Samsung have offered apologies to the nation over the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
The extensive wiretappings, dubbed the "X-files" by South Korean media, revealed
not only problems with the agency, but also collusion between top conglomerates
and politicians _ one of the inveterate ills of South Korean
politics.
</P>
<P>
Family-controlled conglomerates, or chaebol, used to give large and illegal sums
of money, described as "insurance," to both ruling and opposition
candidates.
