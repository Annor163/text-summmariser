<P>
An ex-deputy chief of South Korea's top 
intelligence agency who had been under investigation in connection 
with a scandal over illegal wiretapping was found dead in his flat 
late Sunday, Yonhap news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Lee Soo-il, 63, was found dead in his flat in the southern city 
of Gwangju by a maid, police said according to Yonhap.
</P>
<P>
It said police believe he committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Lee served as a deputy of Shin Gunn, the former head of the 
National Intelligence Service (NIS), from March 2001 to April 2003, 
Yonhap said. 
</P>
<P>
He was under investigation for his involvement in illegal 
wiretapping of politicians and other influential figures under 
former president Kim Dae-Jung, who served from 1998 to 2003, it 
said.
</P>
<P>
Former spy chiefs Shin and Lim Dong-Won were arrested late 
Tuesday on charges of illegal wiretapping and escorted to a 
detention centre, prosecutors said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Both denied the charges but the Seoul District Court issued 
warrants saying they were suspected of playing a role in illicit 
bugging operations.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are looking into allegations that the spy agency had 
bugged wireless phone conversations by about 1,800 politicians, 
businessmen, journalists and even Kim's relatives.
</P>
<P>
The bugging scandal came to light in July this year when a 
former NIS official revealed the existence of 274 intelligence 
service audiotapes.
</P>
<P>
One of the tapes concerned a 1997 conversation between 
Seoul-based newspaper publisher Hong Seok-Hyun and a top Samsung 
official on plans for payoffs to presidential candidates in that 
year's election. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Hong, who quit as ambassador to Washington in 
September, presented himself at the prosecutors office for 
questioning over allegations that he was involved in illegal money 
donations to politicians.
</P>
<P>
South Korea was rattled by widespread corruption scandals last 
year after prosecutors launched a probe into illegal donations 
businesses made to politicians during the 2002 presidential 
elections.
