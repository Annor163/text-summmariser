SEOUL, South Korea
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former top intelligence official killed himself just days after being
questioned about his involvement in a South Korean wiretapping scandal, police
said Monday
</P>
<P>
Lee Soo-il, 63, who worked as deputy chief of the National Intelligence Service
from 2001 to 2003, was found dead by hanging Sunday evening at his home in
Gwangju, about 330 kilometers (200 miles) south of Seoul, said Chung Yong-min,
an officer at the Gwangju Seobu Police Station.
</P>
<P>
An autopsy on Lee's body showed the only cause of death was suffocation, Chung
said.
</P>
<P>
His death comes less than a week after two former chiefs of the country's state
intelligence agency were arrested and charged with overseeing the illegal
wiretapping of mobile phone conversations of about 1,800 of South Korea's
political, corporate and media elite.
</P>
<P>
Lim Dong-won, 71, and Shin Gunn, 64, headed the agency successively between
December 1999 and April 2003 under former President Kim Dae-jung. They have
denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Police declined to comment on why Lee might have taken his own life and no
suicide note was found. But local media speculated his death could be linked to
his involvement in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors questioned Lee on three occasions, most recently Nov. 11. Newspapers
have reported that Lee's remarks to investigators helped prompt the ex-chiefs'
arrests and that he had been tormented by psychological distress ever
since.
</P>
<P>
Former President Kim _ a Nobel Peace Prize laureate _ has protested the arrests
as "unreasonable."
</P>
<P>
His spokesman, Choi Kyung-hwan, has claimed their arrests were politically
motivated.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, North Korea also denounced the arrests, calling the move a
U.S.-instigated attempt by the South's political opposition to "bury key
figures" who contributed to inter-Korean rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the North's official Korean Central News Agency, the
North's Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland condemned the
South's conservative opposition Grand National Party for the arrests, claiming
they were politically motivated and aimed at the "suppression of progressive and
reformist forces."
</P>
<P>
The former spy chief Lim had been a leading proponent of reconciliation with
North Korea under Kim's "sunshine policy" of engaging the communist
state.
</P>
<P>
These efforts earned him the nickname as the "preacher" of the sunshine policy.
Lim was said to have played a key role in setting up the landmark meeting
between Kim and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in 2000.
</P>
<P>
In 2002, Lim visited the North as a presidential envoy and met Kim Jong
Il.
