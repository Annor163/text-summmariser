Former South Korean intelligence chiefs face arrest in wiretapping scandal

<P>
Two former chiefs of South Korea's state intelligence agency were to be
arraigned in court Tuesday on charges they oversaw the agency's illegal
wiretapping of phone conversations of influential figures.
</P>
<P>
Lim Dong-won, 71, and Shin Gunn, 64, headed the National Intelligence Service
successively between December 1999 and April 2003 under former President Kim
Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, prosecutors sought arrest warrants for the two, saying they were
responsible for the spy agency's extensive wiretapping of phone conversations,
including those via mobile phones. Local media reported that the men were
expected in court Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said former President Kim wasn't involved and the two ex-spy chiefs
ignored Kim's instruction to end illegal wiretapping.
</P>
<P>
Yet the prosecution's move was a blow to the image of the former president, a
Nobel Peace Prize laureate who has long championed human rights and
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Kim's spokesman, Choi Gyung-hwan, issued a statement late Monday denouncing the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that the two former chiefs of the National Intelligence Service
have nothing to do with wiretapping," he said. "The government should withdraw
the unfair request for arrest warrants."
</P>
<P>
Lim, a former two-star general, was one of Kim's closest confidants, working as
presidential aide twice and unification minister twice in addition to
intelligence chief during Kim's five-year rule in 1998-2003.
</P>
<P>
Known as the "preacher" of Kim's "sunshine policy" of engagement with North
Korea, Lim was also deeply involved in inter-Korean affairs.
</P>
<P>
He is said to have played a key role in setting up the landmark meeting between
Kim and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in 2000. The unprecedented summit
significantly warmed relations between the two Cold War rivals. In 2002, Lim
visited the North as presidential envoy and met Kim Jong Il one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
The wiretapping scandal began in July after a TV network reported on an alleged
1997 conversation between Hong Seok-hyun, then publisher of the mass-circulation
JoongAng Ilbo, and Lee Hak-soo, a top executive with Samsung Group, the
country's largest industrial conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
In the conversation, the two allegedly discussed providing illicit funds to
candidates in the 1997 presidential race won by Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
The scandal cost Hong his job as South Korea's ambassador to the United States.
On Sunday, he returned to Seoul and prosecutors plan to question him this
week.
</P>
<P>
Samsung and the spy agency have apologized to the nation over the scandal. The
scandal, dubbed the "X-files" by local media, has struck a raw nerve in South
Korea, barely a generation removed from military-backed governments that curbed
civil liberties and quashed dissent.
