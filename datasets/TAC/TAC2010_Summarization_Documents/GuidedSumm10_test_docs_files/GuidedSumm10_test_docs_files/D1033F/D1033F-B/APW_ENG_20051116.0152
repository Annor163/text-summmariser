Two former chiefs of South Korea's state intelligence agency were in jail
Wednesday awaiting trial on charges they oversaw the agency's illegal
wiretapping of influential figures' phone calls, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Lim Dong-won, 71, and Shin Gunn, 64, headed the National Intelligence Service
successively between December 1999 and April 2003 under former President Kim
Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday, the Seoul District Court issued arrest warrants for the two, who
were arrested later that evening. Prosecutors have said they were responsible
for the spy agency's extensive wiretapping of phone conversations.
</P>
<P>
Media said the agency wiretapped mobile phone calls of about 1,800 of the
country's political, corporate and media elite _ including former President Kim
Yong-sam, Kim Dae-jung's predecessor _ when the two accused chiefs held
office.
</P>
<P>
Both accused men have denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry for causing concern to people with the wiretapping incident," Lim
told reporters en route to a detention center south of Seoul. "I feel
responsible as a leader (of the agency) that I failed to uncover wiretapping and
take proper measures against it."
</P>
<P>
Shin also said he neither ordered wiretaps nor received information from
them.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said former President Kim wasn't involved and that the two ex-chiefs
had ignored Kim's instruction to end illegal wiretapping.
</P>
<P>
Yet their arrests tainted the image of the former president, a Nobel Peace Prize
laureate who has long championed human rights and democracy.
</P>
<P>
The wiretapping scandal began in July following revelations of an alleged 1997
conversation between Hong Seok-hyun, then publisher of the mass-circulation
JoongAng Ilbo, and Lee Hak-soo, a top executive with Samsung Group, the
country's largest industrial conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
In the conversation, the two allegedly discussed providing illicit campaign
funds to candidates in the 1997 presidential race, won by Kim
Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
Hong, a brother-in-law of Samsung Chairman Lee Kun-hee, resigned as South
Korea's ambassador to the United States in September over the scandal. On
Wednesday, Hong appeared before prosecutors for questioning.
</P>
<P>
Samsung and the spy agency have apologized to the nation.
</P>
<P>
The scandal, dubbed the "X-files" by media, revealed not only problems with the
agency, but also illicit collusion between top conglomerates and politicians _
one of the inveterate ills of South Korean politics.
</P>
<P>
Family-controlled conglomerates, or chaebol, used to illegally give large sums
of money described as "insurance" to both ruling and opposition
candidates.
